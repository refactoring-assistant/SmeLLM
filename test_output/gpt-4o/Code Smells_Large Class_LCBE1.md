**Code Review: LCBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - A class with many fields, often non-cohesive in its behaviors, indicating the class might have too many responsibilities or is trying to do too much.
- Found in line no. - 3 to 52
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
- Possible solution - Extract separate classes for Address and BankAccount to manage their respective details, reducing the size of the Person class.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types to represent concepts which could be represented as objects, leading to decreased clarity and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 4-12, 26-30, 33-36
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Use objects for Address and BankAccount to encapsulate related primitive fields, improving code clarity and reducing complexity.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - Methods that are excessively long and contain too much information, which can be difficult to read, understand, and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 47-50
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
- Possible solution - Extract a method to handle the printing of address and bank account information, shortening the `printPersonDetails` method for improved readability and maintainability.
