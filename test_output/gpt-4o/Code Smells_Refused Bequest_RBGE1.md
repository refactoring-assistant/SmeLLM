**Code Review: RBGE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive types, such as Characters and Strings, instead of creating specific classes for specific usages or data types represents a form of primitive obsession.
- Found in line no. - [19, 20, 21, 35, 55, 67]
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', ' Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Create classes or enums for structures such as `brand`, `model`, and `key` for better type safety and clearer domain model. For example, a `Key` class could replace the Character type for keys.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The MobileGood class exposes its internal workings via a direct reference to a ComputerGood object, leading to tight coupling between these classes.
- Found in line no. - [54, 57, 60, 61, 64, 65]
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', 'Replace Delegation with Inheritance']
- Possible solution - Encapsulate the functionality related to `ComputerGood` inside `MobileGood` and make `ComputerGood`'s methods private. If necessary, expose methods that interact with `ComputerGood` within `MobileGood` rather than exposing the `ComputerGood` instance itself.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Middle Man
- Code smell description - The `MobileGood` class delegates all functionality to the `ComputerGood` class it holds.
- Found in line no. - [60, 64]
- Possible treatments - ['Remove Middle Man']
- Possible solution - Consider whether `MobileGood` actually needs its own class or whether it should directly extend or utilize `ComputerGood`, possibly by inheritance or different composition patterns.

**Redefined Code:**
```java
enum MouseDirection {
  UP("up"),
  DOWN("down"),
  LEFT("left"),
  RIGHT("right");

  private final String direction;

  MouseDirection(String direction) {
    this.direction = direction;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return direction;
  }
}

class Key {
  private final char key;

  public Key(char key) {
    this.key = key;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.valueOf(key);
  }
}

class DeviceDetails {
  private String brand;
  private String model;
  public DeviceDetails(String brand, String model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }
  public void printDetails() {
    System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + " Model: " + model);
  }
}

// Other class DeviceGood / Usage classes would adapt according to such changes
```
