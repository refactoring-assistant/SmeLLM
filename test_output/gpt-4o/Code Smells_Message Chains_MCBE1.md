**Code Review: MCBE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - **Primitive Obsession**
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types to represent domain ideas such as address without encapsulating them in a meaningful abstraction.
- Found in line no. - 5, 6, 7, 21, 22, 43, 44
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Encapsulate primitive data types into meaningful classes or objects, such as creating a `Salutation` class instead of using a plain `String` for the salutation, or replacing the list of items with an `OrderItems` class.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - **Data Clumps**
- Code smell description - Groups of data items that appear together in multiple places in the codebase and should probably be extracted into their own class or collection for better organization and maintenance.
- Found in line no. - 5-7 (Address fields), 25-28 (Person fields with address)
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - Extract the address fields into their own `Address` class encapsulating street, city, and zip code, and refactor the `PersonBad` constructor to accept an `Address` object instead of separate fields for street, city, and zip code.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - **Duplicate Code**
- Code smell description - Repeated code segments across classes or methods, leading to increased maintenance effort and risk of inconsistencies. For instance, the code pattern representing a person and an address.
- Found in line no. - 9-13 (AddressBad constructor), 25-29 (PersonBad constructor)
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Extract Method & Pull Up Field', 'Pull Up Constructor Body', 'Form Template Method', 'Substitute Algorithm', 'Extract Superclass', 'Extract ClassConsolidate Conditional Expression and use Extract Method', 'Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments']
- Possible solution - Create utility methods or superclasses that handle repeated instantiation logic, reducing scattered responsibility and focusing on constructor uniqueness.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - **Comments**
- Code smell description - Instead of comments explaining complex logic, refactor the code to improve readability and self-documentation.
- Found in line no. - Not specific in the code, but rather indicated by the indentation level and method purpose, notably in the `printOrderDetails` and `printOrderHistory` methods.
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Variable', 'Extract Method', 'Rename Method', 'Introduce Assertion']
- Possible solution - Use meaningful method names and consistent method decomposition to ensure that code segments are self-explanatory and reduce the need for verbose comments.

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - **Large Class**
- Code smell description - Classes that have grown too large and have too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle and making it hard to maintain.
- Found in line no. - 40-76 (OrderBad class)
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
- Possible solution - Break down `OrderBad` into multiple smaller classes, such as separating order handling and item management, potentially introducing additional objects to represent complex constructs within the order.

```java
// Refactored code could include restructuring and introducing classes for repeated patterns such as Address, Salutation, OrderItems
class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String zipCode;
    
    public Address(String street, String city, String zipCode) {
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.zipCode = zipCode;
    }
    
    public String getAddress() {
        return street + ", " + city + ", " + zipCode;
    }
}

class Person {
    private String salutation;
    private String name;
    private Address address;
    
    public Person(String salutation, String name, Address address) {
        this.salutation = salutation;
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return salutation + " " + name;
    }
    
    public Address getAddress() {
        return address;
    }
}

class Order {
    private Person person;
    private int orderNumber;
    private List<String> items = new ArrayList<>();
    private String orderStatus = "Pending";
    private double orderTotal = 0.0;

    public Order(Person person, int orderNumber) {
        this.person = person;
        this.orderNumber = orderNumber;
    }

    public void addItem(String item, double price) {
        orderTotal += price;
        items.add(item);
    }

    public void placeOrder() {
        orderStatus = "Placed";
        System.out.println("Order placed successfully. Cost: " + orderTotal);
    }

    public void printOrderDetails() {
        System.out.println("Order Number: " + orderNumber);
        System.out.println("Order Status: " + orderStatus);
        System.out.println("Order Total: " + orderTotal);
        System.out.println("Items: ");
        for (String item : items) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }
}

class OrderHistory {
    private List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addOrder(Order order) {
        orders.add(order);
    }

    public void printOrderHistory() {
        for (Order order : orders) {
            order.printOrderDetails();
            System.out.println("Person: " + order.getPerson().getName());
            System.out.println("Address: " + order.getPerson().getAddress().getAddress());
        }
    }
}
```
This refactoring introduces distinct `Address` and `Person` classes along with improvements to manage `Order` and `OrderHistory` separately and efficiently.
