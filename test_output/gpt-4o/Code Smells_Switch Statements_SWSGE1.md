**Code Review: SWSGE1.java**
   - Code smell no. - 1
   - Code smell name - No code smells detected
   - Code smell description - The code follows a clear and well-structured design, using inheritance and polymorphism effectively. Each shape class correctly encapsulates behavior relevant to the specific shape, and the main class uses polymorphism to calculate area without knowing the exact details of the shape being processed. There is a good use of abstraction and no detected code smells.
   - Found in line no. - N/A
   - Possible treatments - N/A
   - Possible solution - The existing design is appropriate and does not require changes. Continue following good object-oriented design principles as shown in the implementation.
