**Code Review: TFBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types to represent domain ideas can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. This code has a set of primitive doubles representing various loan properties.
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', ' Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Replace individual primitive data fields with a more meaningful LoanDetails object that encapsulates these details.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Occurs when the same group of data items (such as parameters) is passed around together, forming a data clump that suggests a higher-level object is missing.
- Found in line no. - 9
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - Create a new class to encapsulate the related data fields (perhaps named `LoanDetails`), reducing repetition and simplifying method signatures.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - Long methods can be difficult to read and maintain. The method `calculateInterest` contains a conditional logic that could be decomposed for clarity.
- Found in line no. - 18
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
- Possible solution - Decompose the conditional logic in `calculateInterest` into separate methods for clarity and maintainability.

**Revised Code Implementing Solutions:**

```java
class LoanDetails {
    private double principal;
    private double interestRate;
    private double term;

    public LoanDetails(double principal, double interestRate, double term) {
        this.principal = principal;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
        this.term = term;
    }

    // Getters
    public double getPrincipal() {
        return principal;
    }

    public double getInterestRate() {
        return interestRate;
    }

    public double getTerm() {
        return term;
    }
}

class Loan {
    private LoanDetails loanDetails;
    private double interestAmount;

    public Loan(LoanDetails loanDetails) {
        this.loanDetails = loanDetails;
        this.interestAmount = 0;
    }

    private int calculateNumberOfMonths() {
        if (loanDetails.getTerm() < 1) {
            return (int) Math.ceil(loanDetails.getTerm() * 12);
        }
        return 12;  // assuming 1 year term if not less than 1
    }

    public void calculateInterest() {
        double monthlyInterestRate = loanDetails.getInterestRate() / 12;
        int numMonths = calculateNumberOfMonths();
        interestAmount = loanDetails.getPrincipal() * monthlyInterestRate * numMonths;
    }

    public double returnTotalAmount() {
        return loanDetails.getPrincipal() + interestAmount;
    }
}

public class TFBE1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoanDetails loanDetails = new LoanDetails(1000, 0.1, 0.5);
        Loan loan = new Loan(loanDetails);
        loan.calculateInterest();
        System.out.println("Total amount to be paid: " + loan.returnTotalAmount());
    }
}
```
This refactoring resolves the identified code smells by introducing an object to represent related loan data, decomposing conditionals, and simplifying method implementations.
