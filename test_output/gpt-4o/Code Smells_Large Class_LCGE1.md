**Code Review: LCGE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - A method that is too long can become difficult to understand and maintain. It often does too many things and may benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
- Found in line no. - 94
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
- Possible solution - 
  ```java
  public void printPersonDetails() {
      printFullName();
      address.printAddress();
      bankAccount.printBankDetails();
  }
  
  private void printFullName() {
      System.out.println("Name: " + this.firstname + " " + this.lastname);
  }
  ```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Using primitive data types to represent domain ideas can lead to complex code and bugs due to lack of encapsulation and expressiveness.
- Found in line no. - 43, 44, 45, 46, 54, 55, 56, 57, 76, 77, 86, 90
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', ' Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - 
  ```java
  class BankAccount {
      private final AccountNumber accountNumber;
      private double balance;
      private final AccountType accountType;

      public BankAccount(AccountNumber accountNumber, AccountType accountType){
          this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
          this.balance = 0;
          this.accountType = accountType;
      }

      // Other methods...
  }

  class AccountNumber {
      private String value;

      public AccountNumber(String value) {
          this.value = value;
      }
  }

  enum AccountType {
      CHECKING, SAVINGS
  }
  ```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Occurs when the same group of data items are passed around together in various parts of the code without being encapsulated into an object.
- Found in line no. - 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - 
  ```java
  class AddressGood implements IAddress {
      private AddressValue addressValue;

      public AddressGood(AddressValue addressValue) {
          this.addressValue = addressValue;
      }

      @Override
      public void printAddress() {
          System.out.println("Address: " + addressValue.fullAddress());
      }
  }

  class AddressValue {
      private String street;
      private String city;
      private String state;
      private String zipcode;

      public AddressValue(String street, String city, String state, String zipcode) {
          this.street = street;
          this.city = city;
          this.state = state;
          this.zipcode = zipcode;
      }

      public String fullAddress() {
          return street + ", " + city + ", " + state + ", " + zipcode;
      }
  }
  ```

This code snippet could be improved by encapsulating data values into objects for better maintainability and clarity, and by breaking down long methods into smaller pieces.
