**Code Review: RBGE2.java**
   - Code smell no. - 1
   - Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
   - Code smell description - This smell occurs when one class has to dig deep into another class to use its methods, indicating high coupling. The downcast from `NoteTakerGood` to `IpadNotesGood` in line 27 shows that `main` relies on the concrete implementation to use `shareNotesAsPdf()`, which is not present in the interface `NoteTakerGood`.
   - Found in line no. - 27
   - Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', ' Replace Delegation with Inheritance']
   - Possible solution - Introduce the `shareNotes()` method in the `NoteTakerGood` interface with an empty implementation in `NotebookNotesGood`. This will ensure that the responsibility to share notes is included as part of the `NoteTakerGood` contract, thus avoiding the need for casting.

```java
interface NoteTakerGood {
    void writeNotes();
    default void shareNotes() {
        // Default implementation for those who don't share notes
    }
}

class IpadNotesGood implements NoteTakerGood {
    @Override
    public void writeNotes() {
        System.out.println("Notes written on iPad.");
    }

    @Override
    public void shareNotes() {
        System.out.println("Notes shared as PDF.");
    }
}

class NotebookNotesGood implements NoteTakerGood {
    @Override
    public void writeNotes() {
        System.out.println("Notes written on Notebook.");
    }
}

public class RBGE2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NoteTakerGood ipad = new IpadNotesGood();
        ipad.writeNotes();
        ipad.shareNotes();

        NoteTakerGood notebook = new NotebookNotesGood();
        notebook.writeNotes();
        notebook.shareNotes(); // Will not perform any action by default
    }
}
```
