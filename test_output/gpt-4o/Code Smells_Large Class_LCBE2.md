**Code Review: LCBE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The `IPersonBad` interface and the `PersonBad` class exhibit inappropriate intimacy by mixing responsibilities related to the person and student details in a single interface and class, which suggests a violation of the single responsibility principle.
- Found in line no. - 1, 3, 4, 20, 21, 22, 23
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', ' Replace Delegation with Inheritance']
- Possible solution - Separate the responsibilities by creating distinct classes or interfaces for person and student entities. Here's a revision:

```java
interface IPerson {
    void printPersonDetails();
}

interface IStudent {
    void printStudentDetails();
}

class Person implements IPerson {
    private String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void printPersonDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
    }
}

class Student extends Person implements IStudent {
    private String studentId;
    private String major;

    public Student(String name, String studentId, String major) {
        super(name);
        this.studentId = studentId;
        this.major = major;
    }

    public void printStudentDetails() {
        printPersonDetails();
        System.out.println("Student ID: " + this.studentId);
        System.out.println("Major: " + this.major);
    }
}

public class LCBE2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student1 = new Student("John", "123456", "Computer Science");
        System.out.println("Person details:");
        student1.printPersonDetails();
        System.out.println("Student details:");
        student1.printStudentDetails();
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The `PersonBad` class has mixed responsibilities for both person and student details, making it larger and more complex than necessary.
- Found in line no. - 5, 20, 21, 22, 23
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
- Possible solution - As shown in the solution above, extracting and creating separate classes/interfaces can reduce the complexity of the original class.
