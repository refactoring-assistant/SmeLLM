# Code Review: DVCHGE1.java
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Switch Statements
- Code smell description - The code uses switch statements to handle different cases for LogType and MatrixOperation, which can lead to duplicated code, difficulty in maintenance, and violates Open/Closed principle.
- Found in line no. - 14, 17, 83
- Possible treatments - Extract Method & then Move Method, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods, Introduce Null Object
- Possible solution - Refactor by replacing switch statements with polymorphic classes or strategy pattern to handle logging and matrix operations dynamically, eliminating the switch statements.
