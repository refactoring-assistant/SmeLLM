**Code Review: FEGE1.java**  
- Code smell no. - 1  
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession  
- Code smell description - The use of primitive types (int) for coordinates could be replaced with a dedicated Coordinate class to encapsulate coordinate-related behavior.  
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 12, 16, 20, 32, 33  
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class  
- Possible solution - Create a `Coordinate` class to encapsulate the x and y values, replacing the primitive fields and simplifying coordinate operations.  

- Code smell no. - 2  
- Code smell name - Long Method  
- Code smell description - The method `calculateDistance` incorporates complex mathematical operations that could be extracted for clarity and reusability.  
- Found in line no. - 12-14  
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional  
- Possible solution - Extract the distance calculation into a separate method, such as `calculateDistanceTo(Coordinate point)` within a `Coordinate` class.  

- Code smell no. - 3  
- Code smell name - Data Clumps  
- Code smell description - The group of closely related data fields (x, y, and points array) are repeatedly used together, indicating a data clump.  
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 29, 45, 51  
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object  
- Possible solution - Use the new `Coordinate` class to group coordinate data, replacing multiple individual variables with object references.  

- Code smell no. - 4  
- Code smell name - Switch Statements  
- Code smell description - Not present in the provided code.  
- Found in line no. - N/A  
- Possible treatments - N/A  
- Possible solution - N/A  

- Code smell no. - 5  
- Code smell name - Comment  
- Code smell description - No comments are present, which could hinder maintainability and understanding.  
- Found in line no. - N/A (though comments would improve clarity)  
- Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion  
- Possible solution - Add descriptive comments where complex logic or assumptions are made, e.g., in `checkRectangle`.  

- Code smell no. - 6  
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy  
- Code smell description - The `Rectangle2DSpaceGood` class directly accesses and manipulates data from `Coordinates2DGood` objects, indicating tight coupling.  
- Found in line no. - 51  
- Possible treatments - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Class & Hide Delegate  
- Possible solution - Encapsulate coordinate operations within a dedicated class, reducing subclasses' direct knowledge of internal details.  

**Summary:**  
The primary issues include Primitive Obsession and Data Clumps, which could be mitigated by refactoring to introduce a `Coordinate` class. Extracting methods and adding comments would also improve clarity and maintainability.
