**Code Review: TFGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class `LoanGood` contains multiple responsibilities like storing loan data, interest calculation, and interest amount management, which could be separated.
- Found in line no. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 17, 27, 29
- Possible treatments - Extract Class
- Possible solution - Refactor by creating separate classes, e.g., `InterestCalculator` handling interest calculation, and `LoanDetails` managing loan data, maintaining single responsibility principle.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code uses primitive data types (`double`) to represent complex concepts like rates and terms, which could be encapsulated into dedicated classes for better clarity.
- Found in line no. - 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 41, 42
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object
- Possible solution - Create value objects like `InterestRate`, `Term`, and encapsulate relevant logic and validation within these classes to improve domain modeling.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Switch Statements
- Code smell description - The `calculateInterest()` method contains an `if-else` structure based on the `term`, which could be prone to errors as rules grow; replaced with polymorphism.
- Found in line no. - 17-25
- Possible treatments - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- Possible solution - Implement polymorphic classes for different interest calculation strategies to remove conditional logic.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Temporary Field
- Code smell description - The `monthlyInterestCalculator` field is initialized with a default implementation and conditionally replaced, indicating it might be a temporary placeholder that could be better managed.
- Found in line no. - 6, 14, 19
- Possible treatments - Extract Class or Replace Method with Method Object
- Possible solution - Use factory methods or dependency injection to instantiate appropriate calculators, avoiding placeholder fields.

- No other significant code smells detected.
