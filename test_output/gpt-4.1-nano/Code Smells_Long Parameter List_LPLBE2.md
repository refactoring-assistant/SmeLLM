**Code Review: LPLBE2.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - Multiple classes directly access each other's internal data through method calls, leading to tight coupling and reduced encapsulation.
- Found in line no. - 94
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method, Extract Method, Extract Method with Move Method
- Possible solution - Refactor the `calculateCartPrice` method to encapsulate the calculation within a dedicated class or method that manages data access more appropriately, reducing direct coupling between `ShoppingCartBad` and other classes.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The `calculateCartPrice` method performs numerous calculations in a single block, which could be split into smaller, more manageable pieces for clarity and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 70-80
- Possible treatments - Extract Method & then Move Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
- Possible solution - Decompose the `calculateCartPrice` method into smaller methods such as `calculateProductTotal`, `applyDiscounts`, and `calculateFinalPrice`.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Use of primitive data types (doubles and ints) to represent domain concepts like discounts, taxes, and fees, leading to less expressive code.
- Found in line no. - 70, 78, 94
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
- Possible solution - Replace related primitives like `discounts`, `tax`, and `fees` with dedicated value objects that encapsulate their respective behaviors and validations.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - Classes like `StorePricingBad`, `StoreMemberPricingBad`, and `ShoppingCartBad` handle multiple responsibilities such as pricing, discounts, fees, and cart management.
- Found in line no. - 27, 58
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data
- Possible solution - Break down large classes into smaller, focused classes such as `Pricing`, `Discounts`, and `Cart`.
