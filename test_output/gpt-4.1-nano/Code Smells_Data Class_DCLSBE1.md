**Code Review: DCLSBE1.java**  
- Code smell no. - 1  
- Code smell name - Large Class  
- Code smell description - The class `RectangleBad` encapsulates only data without behavior, leading to a class that primarily stores data with very little functionality, which is a sign of a Large Class smell.  
- Found in line no. - 1 to 17  
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Duplicate Observed Data  
- Possible solution - Extract `Rectangle` data into a dedicated class and create separate utility classes or methods for calculations related to rectangles.  

- Code smell no. - 2  
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy  
- Code smell description - The methods `calculateRectanglePerimeter` and `calculateRectangleArea` depend on `RectangleBad`â€™s getters instead of integrating behavior within the `RectangleBad` class itself, indicating tight coupling and inappropriate access.  
- Found in line no. - 20 to 26  
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method, Extract Method with Move Method  
- Possible solution - Add methods like `calculatePerimeter()` and `calculateArea()` directly inside `RectangleBad`.  

- Code smell no. - 3  
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession  
- Code smell description - The class uses primitive types (`double`) to represent dimensions, which could be replaced with value objects to improve encapsulation and future flexibility.  
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15  
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object  
- Possible solution - Create `Dimension` class to encapsulate width and height, and update code to use this object instead of primitives.
