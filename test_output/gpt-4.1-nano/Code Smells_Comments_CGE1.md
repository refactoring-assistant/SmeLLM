**Code Review: CGE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 1  
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession  
- **Code smell description** - Usage of primitive data types (String for orderStatus) to represent fixed states, which can lead to errors and less maintainable code.  
- **Found in line no.** - 18, 19, 36  
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy, Replace Type Code with Class  
- **Possible solution** - Introduce an `OrderStatus` enum to replace the `String` type for order status, improving clarity and type safety.

- **Code smell no.** - 2  
- **Code smell name** - Long Method  
- **Code smell description** - Methods that do too much or are excessively lengthy, making them hard to understand and maintain.  
- **Found in line no.** - 17 to 27  
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional  
- **Possible solution** - Break down `calculateOrderAmount()` into smaller, focused methods such as `calculateTotalCost()`, `applyDiscount()`, and `applyTax()` for better readability.

- **Code smell no.** - 3  
- **Code smell name** - Data Clumps  
- **Code smell description** - Grouping of variables that are passed around together (e.g., `numItems` and `perItemCost`) that can be encapsulated as a class.  
- **Found in line no.** - 17, 41  
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object  
- **Possible solution** - Create an `OrderDetails` class that encapsulates `numItems` and `perItemCost`, and pass an instance of this class to `calculateOrderAmount()`.

- **Code smell no.** - 4  
- **Code smell name** - Comments  
- **Code smell description** - Overuse of comments that may indicate complex code or poor naming, or redundant comments.  
- **Found in line no.** - 36  
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method  
- **Possible solution** - Replace comments with well-named methods or variables to make the code self-explanatory.

**Summary**:  
The code exhibits **Primitive Obsession** with the `orderStatus` string, an opportunity to improve method size and clarity with **Long Method** refactoring, and potential for better data organization with **Data Clumps**. Addressing these would enhance code maintainability and readability.
