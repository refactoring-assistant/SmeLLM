**Code Review: LMGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code extensively uses primitive types like String, float, int, and Date for core data representation instead of encapsulating them within specific classes, leading to potential duplication and reduced clarity.
- Found in line no. - 23-28, 41-44, 70-75, 86-139
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Array with Object
- Possible solution - Define dedicated classes for monetary amounts, transaction identifiers, and date/time handling to encapsulate primitive data and behaviors.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The method makeTransaction and printTransactionStatus contain multiple responsibilities and lengthy code blocks, reducing readability and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 86-98, 154-166
- Possible treatments - Extract Method
- Possible solution - Break down complex methods into smaller, focused methods such as validateTransaction(), processTransaction(), and displayStatus().

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Switch Statements
- Code smell description - The switch statement in printTransactionStatus handles different transaction statuses but is prone to errors and hard to extend.
- Found in line no. - 155-166
- Possible treatments - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- Possible solution - Use polymorphic TransactionStatus classes or an enum with behavior to eliminate the switch statement.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Multiple pieces of related data such as card details, transaction info, and account statuses are grouped together but not encapsulated, leading to scattered data management.
- Found in line no. - 23-28, 41-44, 70-75
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object
- Possible solution - Create dedicated classes for card details, transaction info, and account state to organize related data together.
