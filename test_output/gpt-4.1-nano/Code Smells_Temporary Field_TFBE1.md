**Code Review: TFBE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Large Class
- **Code smell description** - The class `LoanBad` contains multiple responsibilities such as handling loan parameters, calculating interest, and returning total amount, making it large and potentially difficult to maintain.
- **Found in line no.** - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9-31
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class
- **Possible solution** - Refactor by splitting `LoanBad` into multiple classes, e.g., `LoanParameters`, `InterestCalculator`, and `LoanSummary`, to separate data, calculation logic, and presentation.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code uses primitive data types (`double`, `int`) for key domain concepts like interest rate and number of months, which could be better represented by value objects.
- **Found in line no.** - 2-7, 9-31
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object
- **Possible solution** - Introduce classes like `InterestRate`, `Term`, and `PaymentPeriod`, encapsulating relevant data and behaviors.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - The method `calculateInterest()` contains conditional logic that could be decomposed into smaller, focused methods, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **Found in line no.** - 18-26
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method & then Move Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution** - Refactor `calculateInterest()` into `calculateInterestForShortTerm()` and `calculateInterestForLongTerm()` methods, then invoke accordingly.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Duplicate Code
- **Code smell description** - The calculation of interest for short-term and long-term loans are similar but repeated in different branches of the conditional.
- **Found in line no.** - 20-21, 24-25
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method
- **Possible solution** - Common interest calculation logic should be extracted into a separate method, reused in both scenarios.

- **Code smell no.** - 5
- **Code smell name** - Inappropriate Intimacy
- **Code smell description** - The `LoanBad` class directly manipulates internal data and calculations, which may tightly couple it with other parts of the code or external classes.
- **Found in line no.** - 18-26
- **Possible treatments** - Hide Delegate, Extract Class & Hide Delegate
- **Possible solution** - Encapsulate loan calculation details in a dedicated class to reduce tight coupling.

- **Code smell no.** - 6
- **Code smell name** - Comments
- **Code smell description** - There are no comments in the code, making it less understandable.
- **Found in line no.** - N/A
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- **Possible solution** - Add comments or rename methods for clarity to improve understandability.
