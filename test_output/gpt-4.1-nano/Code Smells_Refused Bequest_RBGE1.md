**Code Review: RBGE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 23
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code uses primitive data types (String, Character) to represent concepts like direction and clicked keys, which encapsulation could improve.
- **Found in line no.** - 23, 35, 55, 67
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution** - Create specific classes or enums for keys and directions to encapsulate behavior and data, reducing reliance on primitive data types.

- **Code smell no.** - 22
- **Code smell name** - Switch Statements
- **Code smell description** - The method `switchOnOff()` leverages a ternary operation to switch states, which if expanded to multiple states, could lead to complex conditional logic.
- **Found in line no.** - 33
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- **Possible solution** - Use State pattern to handle different device states, removing explicit conditionals for toggling.

- **Code smell no.** - 29
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - The method `printDetails()` has minimal logic, but if expanded or multiple similar methods are present, it could become a candidate.
- **Found in line no.** - 30
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution** - Keep method concise; extract parts if complex logic is added later.

- **Code smell no.** - 18
- **Code smell name** - Large Class
- **Code smell description** - `ComputerGood` and `MobileGood` encapsulate many responsibilities; especially, `ComputerGood` manages both hardware details and state transitions.
- **Found in line no.** - 18
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- **Possible solution** - Separate hardware details and control logic into dedicated classes to adhere to Single Responsibility Principle.

- **Code smell no.** - 53
- **Code smell name** - Data Class
- **Code smell description** - Classes like `ComputerGood` and `MobileGood` mainly store data and delegate behavior to other classes, indicating an over-reliance on data structures without enough encapsulation.
- **Found in line no.** - 54, 56
- **Possible treatments** - Encapsulate Field, Move Method and Extract Method
- **Possible solution** - Encapsulate fields with accessors; add behavior to classes instead of relying on external functions.

- **Code smell no.** - 71
- **Code smell name** - Comments
- **Code smell description** - The code contains comments that do not add value or are redundant, which can clutter the codebase.
- **Found in line no.** - 72, 73, 81
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method
- **Possible solution** - Remove/Refactor comments that do not add meaningful information; use clear naming for methods and variables instead.

*Note:* Overall, the code is relatively clean but could benefit from encapsulation, better state management, and reducing primitive obsession to enhance maintainability and adherence to SOLID principles.
