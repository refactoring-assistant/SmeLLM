# Code Review: RBBE1.java

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code uses simple strings and characters for important properties like brand, model, and keys, which can be better represented as value objects.
- **Found in line no.** - 19, 20, 21, 39, 70
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution** - Define dedicated classes for Brand, Model, and Key to encapsulate their behaviors and constraints.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Switch Statements
- **Code smell description** - The `moveMouse()` method uses a switch-like behavior through enum and System.out.println, which may grow in complexity.
- **Found in line no.** - 42-45
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- **Possible solution** - Use polymorphism for different `MouseDirectionBad` behaviors if they differ significantly, or refactor to a more flexible design pattern.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Large Class
- **Code smell description** - The `ComputerBad` class handles multiple responsibilities such as power state, printing details, and input handling.
- **Found in line no.** - 18-54
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- **Possible solution** - Separate input handling, display, and power management into dedicated classes.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Comments
- **Code smell description** - The code contains minimal commenting; more explanatory comments could make understanding easier.
- **Found in line no.** - 32, 36, 40, 44, 46, 50, 71
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- **Possible solution** - Add descriptive comments for complex methods or logic to improve maintainability.

- **Code smell no.** - 5
- **Code smell name** - Duplicate Code
- **Code smell description** - Similar print statements and methods for turning on and off power are duplicated.
- **Found in line no.** - 48-49, 51-52
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Pull Up Constructor Body
- **Possible solution** - Consolidate power toggle logic into a single method in a utility class or superclass.

There are no evident indications of other major code smells such as Lazy Class, Dead Code, or Data Class.

**Summary:**  
The primary concerns are Primitive Obsession and Large Class, along with minor issues like switch handling and comments. Refactoring towards value objects, extracting responsibilities, and improving documentation can significantly enhance code quality.
