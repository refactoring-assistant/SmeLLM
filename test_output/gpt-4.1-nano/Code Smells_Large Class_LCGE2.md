**Code Review: LCGE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The `StudentGood` class calls the `printPersonDetails()` method, which is a part of its superclass `PersonGood`. This direct access indicates a tight coupling and unnecessary intimacy between classes, potentially violating encapsulation.
- Found in line no. - 32
- Possible treatments - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Class & Hide Delegate
- Possible solution - Refactor to hide delegate or access data through a more controlled interface, possibly by adding a method in `PersonGood` to retrieve necessary information rather than exposing internal details directly.
