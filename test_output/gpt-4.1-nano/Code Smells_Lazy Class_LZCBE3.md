**Code Review: LZCBE3.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The class uses primitive data types (int) to represent a complex concept (RGB color). This pattern can lead to duplicated code and difficulty in maintaining the code.
- Found in line no. - 5, 6, 7, 15
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object
- Possible solution - Create a dedicated class (e.g., ColorComponent) to encapsulate red, green, and blue components, reducing the reliance on primitive types and improving code clarity.
