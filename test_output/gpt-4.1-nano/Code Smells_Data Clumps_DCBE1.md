**Code Review: DCBE1.java**  
- Code smell no. 1 - Switch Statements  
- Code smell name - None detected  
- Code smell description - No switch statements present in the code.  
- Found in line no. - N/A  
- Possible treatments - N/A  
- Possible solution - N/A  

- Code smell no. 2 - Large Class  
- Code smell name - Large Class  
- Code smell description - The class `FlightBookingBad` encapsulates many data fields and behavior, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. It manages customer details, flight details, and updating methods all within one class.  
- Found in line no. - 3 to 66  
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data  
- Possible solution - Extract separate classes for CustomerDetails, FlightDetails, and BookingStatus to modularize responsibilities.  

- Code smell no. 3 - Primitive Obsession  
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession  
- Code smell description - Use of multiple String fields for customer and flight details which could be encapsulated into value objects or data transfer objects for better structure.  
- Found in line no. - 4 to 23  
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class  
- Possible solution - Create CustomerInfo and FlightInfo value objects to group related data fields.  

- Code smell no. 4 - Long Method  
- Code smell name - Long Method  
- Code smell description - Methods like `updateCustomerContactDetails`, `updateOriginDetails`, and `updateReturnOriginDetails` contain multiple conditional checks and updates, which can be extracted for clarity.  
- Found in line no. - 28 to 52  
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional  
- Possible solution - Break down each update method into smaller methods focusing on individual tasks for clarity and maintainability.  

- Code smell no. 5 - Duplicated Code  
- Code smell name - Duplicated Code  
- Code smell description - The validation code comparing customer details is repeated across multiple update methods.  
- Found in line no. - 30, 39, 47  
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Consolidate Conditional Expression and use Extract Method  
- Possible solution - Create a validation method to verify customer identity, reducing redundancy.  

**Summary:**  
The core issues are the large class size, primitive data types that could be encapsulated, and repetitive validation logic. Refactoring by extracting specialized classes, methods, and validations will improve code clarity, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.
