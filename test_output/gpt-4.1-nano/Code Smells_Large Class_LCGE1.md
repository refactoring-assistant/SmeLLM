**Code Review: LCGE1.java**

- **Code smell no. 1**
  - **Code smell name:** Large Class
  - **Code smell description:** The classes such as `AddressGood`, `BankAccountGood`, and `PersonGood` encapsulate multiple responsibilities related to data storage and representation, which could be split into smaller, more focused classes.
  - **Found in line no.:** 18-41, 43-71, 73-99
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Class
  - **Possible solution:** Refactor each class into smaller classes if needed, or separate data structures from behavior to reduce class size and improve clarity.

- **Code smell no. 2**
  - **Code smell name:** Primitive Obsession
  - **Code smell description:** Use of raw `String`, `double` for critical data like address components and bank details instead of specialized value objects improves maintainability and type safety.
  - **Found in line no.:** 19-22, 44-46, 50, 54, 56, 61, 65
  - **Possible treatments:** Replace Data Value with Object
  - **Possible solution:** Encapsulate address components into an `Address` object, and financial data into a `Money` or `Balance` object.

- **Code smell no. 3**
  - **Code smell name:** Long Method
  - **Code smell description:** Methods such as `printAddress` and `printBankDetails` concatenate multiple pieces of data, leading to large, complex methods.
  - **Found in line no.:** 39, 69
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Method
  - **Possible solution:** Break down complex print statements into smaller helper methods for each field.

- **Code smell no. 4**
  - **Code smell name:** Data Clumps
  - **Code smell description:** The four address fields (street, city, state, zipcode) are often grouped together, suggesting they should be a single value object.
  - **Found in line no.:** 19-22, 30-35
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Class
  - **Possible solution:** Create an `Address` class to hold all address-related fields.

- **Code smell no. 5**
  - **Code smell name:** Inappropriate Intimacy
  - **Code smell description:** Classes (`PersonGood`, `BankAccountGood`, `AddressGood`) directly access each other's data and methods which can lead to tight coupling.
  - **Found in line no.:** 96, 97
  - **Possible treatments:** Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional
  - **Possible solution:** Use more encapsulation and expose only necessary methods, avoiding tight coupling.

- **Code smell no. 6**
  - **Code smell name:** Comments
  - **Code smell description:** The code lacks comments, making understanding and maintenance harder.
  - **Found in line no.:** Entire code
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
  - **Possible solution:** Add descriptive comments and proper naming conventions.

No other significant code smells are observed.

**Summary:** The main issues are large classes, primitive obsession, data clumps, and potential tight coupling. Applying the mentioned treatments will improve code maintainability and clarity.
