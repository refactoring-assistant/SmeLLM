**Code Review: DEDCGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code uses primitive data types (double) to represent related physics parameters, which can be encapsulated into a dedicated class to improve readability and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Create a `PhysicsParameters` class to encapsulate gravity, initial velocity, time, and final velocity, and use that class instead of individual primitives.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The `PhysicsEngineGood` class handles multiple responsibilities such as data storage, calculation, and displaying data, which could be separated to improve cohesion.
- Found in line no. - 2 to 22
- Possible treatments - Extract Class
- Possible solution - Split the `PhysicsEngineGood` class into dedicated classes: one for data storage (`PhysicsParameters`), one for calculations, and one for presentation.
