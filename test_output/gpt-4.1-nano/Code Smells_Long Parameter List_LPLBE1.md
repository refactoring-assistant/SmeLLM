**Code Review: LPLBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The `PersonBad` class combines multiple responsibilities: personal data, address, and bank account information, making it complex and hard to maintain.
- Found in line no. - 35-51
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Superclass & Extract Subclass
- Possible solution - Separate `Person`, `Address`, and `BankAccount` classes into distinct entities to decompose responsibilities.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Primitive types like `String` for `accountNumber`, `accountType`, and `zip`, and `int` for `age`, are used directly instead of encapsulating them into specific value objects.
- Found in line no. - 18-21, 37-39
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Create value objects such as `AccountNumber`, `ZipCode`, or `Age` to encapsulate primitive data.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The `getPersonDetails()` method constructs a detailed string by concatenating multiple attributes, which can be split into multiple cleaner methods.
- Found in line no. - 48-50
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- Possible solution - Break down `getPersonDetails()` into smaller methods like `getAddressDetails()`, `getBankAccountDetails()`, and assemble the strings separately.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - The address fields (`street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`) are passed together or stored as separate variables, indicating grouped data that could be encapsulated.
- Found in line no. - 41
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Use an `Address` class as already done, but ensure usage consistently wherever address data is handled.

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - There are no comments in the code, which could make maintenance harder, especially in complex classes.
- Found in line no. - N/A
- Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- Possible solution - Add comments for clarity, especially for complex string concatenations or logic.

*Note:* The code exhibits some code smells like Large Class, Primitive Obsession, and Long Method, which are typical in poorly modularized code. The main recommendation is to refactor into smaller, focused classes with clear responsibilities.
