**Code Review: DCGE2.java**

- **Code smell no. 1**
- **Code smell name:** Large Class
- **Code smell description:** The class `TwinCityWeatherSeriesGood` manages multiple lists and methods related to weather data, combined into a single class, which can make it hard to maintain or extend.
- **Found in line no.:** 4-38
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Class
- **Possible solution:** Split `TwinCityWeatherSeriesGood` into separate classes, such as `WeatherData`, holding the list and methods for a single city, and a `WeatherComparator` class for comparison logic.

- **Code smell no. 2**
- **Code smell name:** Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description:** The code uses List<Integer> to store weather data, handling primitive data directly rather than encapsulating weather data into dedicated value objects.
- **Found in line no.:** 4-36
- **Possible treatments:** Replace Data Value with Object
- **Possible solution:** Create a `WeatherMeasurement` class to encapsulate weather data attributes, and use a list of that class.

- **Code smell no. 3**
- **Code smell name:** Long Method
- **Code smell description:** Methods like `averageAcross2Weathers()` include for-loops within a method, combining multiple steps into a single method.
- **Found in line no.:** 55-64
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Method
- **Possible solution:** Break down complex methods into smaller, focused methods to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Code smell no. 4**
- **Code smell name:** Data Clumps
- **Code smell description:** Passing the entire `TwinCityWeatherSeriesGood` object repeatedly to methods for data access indicates data clumps that could be encapsulated.
- **Found in line no.:** 55, 41
- **Possible treatments:** Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution:** Pass the object as a parameter and access its data via getter methods, possibly hiding internal details.

- **Code smell no. 5**
- **Code smell name:** Comments
- **Code smell description:** There are no comments in the code, which can make understanding logic harder.
- **Found in line no.:** N/A (no comments observed)
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Method, Rename Method, or Add Comments
- **Possible solution:** Add descriptive comments for complex methods or logic sections to improve code clarity.

*Note:* The code mainly exhibits issues with class responsibilities and primitive data handling; no other significant code smells like duplicated code or switch statements are detected.
