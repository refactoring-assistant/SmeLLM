**Code Review: FEBE1.java**
  
- **Code smell no. 1**  
  - **Code smell name:** Primitive Obsession  
  - **Code smell description:** The code uses simple data primitives (like `int`) to represent coordinates and dimensions, which could be encapsulated into dedicated classes for better clarity and maintainability.  
  - **Found in line no.:** 2, 3, 15, 16  
  - **Possible treatments:** Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Array with Object  
  - **Possible solution:** Create `Coordinate` and `Dimension` classes to encapsulate x, y and length, breadth respectively.  

- **Code smell no. 2**  
  - **Code smell name:** Long Method  
  - **Code smell description:** The method `calculateDistance()` performs multiple calculations and could be modularized for better readability and reusability.  
  - **Found in line no.:** 47  
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object  
  - **Possible solution:** Split `calculateDistance()` into smaller methods such as `calculateXDistance()` and `calculateYDistance()`.  

- **Code smell no. 3**  
  - **Code smell name:** Large Class  
  - **Code smell description:** The `Rectangle2DSpaceBad` class handles validation, calculation, and data storage, which makes it large and less cohesive.  
  - **Found in line no.:** 14-51  
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data  
  - **Possible solution:** Separate validation logic into a dedicated class, such as `RectangleValidator`, and keep the `Rectangle` class focused on properties and calculations.  

- **Code smell no. 4**  
  - **Code smell name:** Comments  
  - **Code smell description:** No explicit comments are present which could improve understandability; however, this is subtle and may not be a significant smell here.  
  - **Found in line no.:** Not applicable  
  - **Possible treatments:** Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion  
  - **Possible solution:** Add comments and rename methods for clarity if needed.  

- **Code smell no. 5**  
  - **Code smell name:** Data Class  
  - **Code smell description:** `Coordinates2DBad` and related classes primarily hold data with minimal behavior, which can be considered a Data Class.  
  - **Found in line no.:** 2-12  
  - **Possible treatments:** Encapsulate Field, Encapsulate Collection, Move Method and Extract Method  
  - **Possible solution:** Convert `Coordinates2DBad` to a proper value object with validation or methods that operate on data, or encapsulate the data better.

**Summary:**  
The primary issues are primitive obsession, the large size of the rectangle class, and some potential for method refactoring. Applying the treatments can result in more maintainable, clearer, and more robust code.
