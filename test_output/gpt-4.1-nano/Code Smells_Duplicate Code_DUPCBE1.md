**Code Review: DUPCBE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 16
- Code smell name - Duplicate Code
- Code smell description - The print statements for owner, account number, and balance are repeated across multiple methods (deposit, withdraw, transfer), leading to code duplication.
- Found in line no. - 14, 22, 30
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
- Possible solution - Create a dedicated private method such as `printAccountDetails()` that encapsulates the repeated print logic, and invoke it within deposit, withdraw, and transfer methods.

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class `BankAccountBad` contains multiple responsibilities, including handling account operations and performing console output, making it too large and unwieldy.
- Found in line no. - 2-24
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- Possible solution - Separate account data management from presentation logic by moving the print statements into a new class responsible for user interface or logging.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Use of primitive data types like `double` for monetary values and `String` for account identifiers without encapsulation or validation may lead to errors.
- Found in line no. - 2, 4, 6, 12, 19, 26
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Encapsulate monetary values within a dedicated `Money` class or similar, and consider creating value objects for account identifiers for better validation.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - Methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `transfer` contain multiple statements, including state change and output, which can be refactored.
- Found in line no. - 12-17, 19-24, 26-32
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- Possible solution - Refactor these methods to extract the common print logic into separate methods, reducing their length and complexity.

**Summary**:  
The code exhibits duplicate print logic across multiple methods, large classes handling multiple responsibilities, and primitive data types used for sensitive data. Applying treatments like extracting methods, decoupling presentation from logic, and encapsulating primitive data types will greatly improve maintainability and clarity.
