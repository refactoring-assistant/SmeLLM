**Code Review: LZCBE2.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The subclass `PrintHelloUserBad` directly accesses the behavior (`printGreetings()`) of its superclass, which indicates tight coupling. This can lead to fragile code organization and unintended dependencies.
- Found in line no. - 17
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method, Extract Method with Move Method
- Possible solution - Refactor `PrintGreetingsBad` and `PrintHelloUserBad` to minimize direct access to superclass methods, possibly by encapsulating shared behaviors or using composition instead of inheritance.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - The class `PrintGreetingsBad` holds only a single data field `userName` which is passed around, but as the application grows, related data may cluster together leading to complex data management.
- Found in line no. - 2, 4, 7
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Encapsulate `userName` and related information into a separate data object if more related data appears.
