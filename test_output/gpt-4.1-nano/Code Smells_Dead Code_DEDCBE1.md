**Code Review: DEDCBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The class uses primitive data types (double) to represent multiple related properties, leading to scattered data management and less clarity.
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Create a 'PhysicsParameters' class encapsulating gravity, initial velocity, time, finalVelocity, and distance, and pass this object to relevant methods, thus replacing scattered primitive variables with a single, cohesive object.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class PhysicsEngineBad handles multiple responsibilities like storing physics parameters, calculating distance, velocity, and printing parameters, violating the single responsibility principle.
- Found in line no. - 2 through 28
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- Possible solution - Refactor by extracting physics calculations and printing into separate classes, e.g., 'PhysicsCalculator' and 'PhysicsPrinter', leaving 'PhysicsEngineBad' to act as a coordinator.
