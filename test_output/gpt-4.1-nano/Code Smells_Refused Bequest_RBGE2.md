**Code Review: RBGE2.java**
  
- **Code smell no.** - 1  
- **Code smell name** - Inappropriate Interface Segregation  
- **Code smell description** - The interface `NoteTakerGood` contains a single method, but some classes implementing it (like `IpadNotesGood`) have additional methods such as `shareNotesAsPdf()`, which are not part of the interface. This indicates that the interface is not sufficiently segregated to match the actual usage.  
- **Found in line no.** - 1, 5, 16, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30  
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Type Code with Interface, Extract Interface, Rename Method  
- **Possible solution** - Refactor the code to create smaller, more specific interfaces such as `NoteWriter` for `writeNotes()` and a separate interface `NoteSharer` for `shareNotesAsPdf()`. Classes can then implement only the relevant interfaces, adhering better to the Interface Segregation Principle.
