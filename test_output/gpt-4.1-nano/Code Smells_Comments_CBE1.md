**Code Review: CBE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 1  
- **Code smell name** - Long Method  
- **Code smell description** - The `solve` method performs multiple calculations and comments, making it lengthy and complex, which hampers readability and maintainability.  
- **Found in line no.** - 20 to 27  
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional  
- **Possible solution** - Refactor the `solve` method by extracting the calculation logic into smaller, well-named methods such as `calculateSubtotal`, `applyDiscount`, and `applyTax`, enhancing clarity and reusability.
