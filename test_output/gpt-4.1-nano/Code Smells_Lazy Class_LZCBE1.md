**Code Review: LZCBE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code uses primitive arrays (`int[][]`) to represent matrices, which leads to scattered and unstructured data handling, making it susceptible to errors and less flexible.
- **Found in line no.** - 10, 11, 12, 21, 25, 29, 33, 34, 35, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Encapsulate Field, Introduce Parameter Object
- **Possible solution** - Create a `Matrix` class that encapsulates the 2D array and related operations, improving code clarity and maintainability.

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Switch Statements
- **Code smell description** - The `performAddSubtractOperation` method uses conditional logic (`if-else`) to determine the operation, which can be replaced with polymorphism for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Found in line no.** - 41, 44, 46
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or State/Strategy
- **Possible solution** - Implement an `Operation` interface with `add` and `subtract` implementations, then pass the corresponding operation object to `performAddSubtractOperation`.

---

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - The method `performAddSubtractOperation` is doing multiple tasks (looping, conditional logic), making it lengthy and more difficult to understand.
- **Found in line no.** - 41
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method
- **Possible solution** - Break down the method into smaller, focused methods such as `performAddition` and `performSubtraction`.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Inappropriate Intimacy
- **Code smell description** - `MatrixOperationBad` tightly couples with `MatrixOperationValidatorBad` by creating its instance internally, which exposes unnecessary dependencies.
- **Found in line no.** - 15
- **Possible treatments** - Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional, Extract Class & Hide Delegate
- **Possible solution** - Inject the validator dependency via constructor, increasing flexibility and reducing coupling.

---

- **Code smell no.** - 5
- **Code smell name** - Data Class
- **Code smell description** - The classes primarily hold data and do very little behavior, indicating a data class smell.
- **Found in line no.** - 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 25, 29, 33, 34, 35, 43, 44, 45
- **Possible treatments** - Encapsulate Field, Move Method and Extract Method
- **Possible solution** - Refactor by creating a `Matrix` class with methods for matrix operations, encapsulating the data and behaviors together.

---

**Summary:**
- Significant code smells relate to Primitive Obsession, Switch Statements, Long Methods, Inappropriate Intimacy, and Data Classes.
- Refactoring suggestions focus on creating dedicated `Matrix` and `Operation` classes, leveraging polymorphism to replace conditionals, and dependency injection to improve coupling.
