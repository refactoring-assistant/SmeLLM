**Code Review: CBE2.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - The `printDifferentMatrix()` method performs multiple steps: printing the original matrix, creating a transposed matrix, and printing the transposed matrix, which can be split into smaller, focused methods.
- **Found in line no.** - 8 to 22
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method
- **Possible solution** - Break down `printDifferentMatrix()` into separate methods: one for printing the original matrix, one for creating the transposed matrix, and one for printing it. This enhances readability and maintainability.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Data Clumps
- **Code smell description** - The `matrix` data is passed around and used multiple times; it would be better encapsulated within a dedicated class or data structure to prevent scattered handling.
- **Found in line no.** - 4, 10, 13, 16, 25, 26
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object
- **Possible solution** - Encapsulate the matrix in a class or data object that can handle operations on matrix data, reducing scattered data handling.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The matrix is represented by a 2D array (`int[][]`), which hard-codes the data type, reducing flexibility and clarity.
- **Found in line no.** - 2, 13, 24
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object
- **Possible solution** - Create a `Matrix` class that encapsulates a 2D array and related operations, improving type safety and clarity.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Long Parameter List
- **Code smell description** - The constructor of `MatrixBad` takes a large data structure, but since there's only one parameter, no immediate refactoring is necessary. However, if more parameters were added, this would become an issue.
- **Found in line no.** - 4
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Parameter with Method Call, Introduce Parameter Object
- **Possible solution** - Not applicable here, as the parameter list is minimal.
