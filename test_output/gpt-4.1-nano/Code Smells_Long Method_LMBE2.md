**Code Review: LMBE2.java**

- **Code smell no. 1**
- **Code smell name:** Large Method
- **Code smell description:** The method `calculateAllMotion` performs multiple calculations and prints multiple results, violating the single responsibility principle and making it hard to maintain or understand.
- **Found in line no.:** 11-26
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution:** Break `calculateAllMotion` into smaller methods, each performing a single calculation or print statement, to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Code smell no. 2**
- **Code smell name:** Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description:** Use of primitive types (`double`, `int`) to represent complex concepts such as velocity, displacement, and energy, which could be encapsulated in dedicated classes.
- **Found in line no.:** 2-4, 11-26
- **Possible treatments:** Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution:** Create classes like `Velocity`, `Displacement`, `Energy`, and `Time`, to encapsulate related data and behaviors.

- **Code smell no. 3**
- **Code smell name:** Long Parameter List
- **Code smell description:** The method `calculateAllMotion` has a long list of parameters (`time`, `mass`), increasing complexity and reducing clarity.
- **Found in line no.:** 11
- **Possible treatments:** Replace Parameter with Method Call, Preserve Whole Object, Introduce Parameter Object
- **Possible solution:** Use a parameter object that contains `time` and `mass`, simplifying the method signature.

- **Code smell no. 4**
- **Code smell name:** Data Clumps
- **Code smell description:** The group of variables `initialDisplacement`, `initialVelocity` are tightly related but are handled separately.
- **Found in line no.:** 2-3
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution:** Create a class `InitialState` containing `displacement` and `velocity`, reducing data clumps.

- **Code smell no. 5**
- **Code smell name:** Comments
- **Code smell description:** The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of calculations, making it harder to understand the logic.
- **Found in line no.:** 11-26
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- **Possible solution:** Add comments, descriptive variable names, or extract specific calculations into well-named methods.

*No other significant code smells detected.*

**Summary:**  
The code contains issues such as a large method performing multiple calculations, primitive obsession with basic types, long parameter list, and data clumps, which could benefit from refactoring into more modular, encapsulated classes and methods for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.
