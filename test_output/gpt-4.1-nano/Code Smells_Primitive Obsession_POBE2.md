# Code Review: POBE2.java

### 1. Code smell no. - 1  
**Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession  
**Code smell description** - The code relies heavily on String values for employee types, which can lead to errors and duplicated code.  
**Found in line no.** - 10–15, 25–35  
**Possible treatments** - Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy  
**Possible solution** - Introduce an enum or class hierarchy for employee types to handle salary and other behaviors, reducing string comparison and making the code more maintainable.

---

### 2. Code smell no. - 2  
**Code smell name** - Long Method  
**Code smell description** - The `setSalary` method contains multiple conditional branches handling different employee types, making it complex and harder to maintain.  
**Found in line no.** - 25–35  
**Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Decompose Conditional  
**Possible solution** - Use polymorphism by creating subclasses for each employee type that define their salary, removing the conditional logic.

---

### 3. Code smell no. - 3  
**Code smell name** - Data Clumps  
**Code smell description** - Employee details such as name, ID, type, and salary are scattered and managed individually, suggesting they could be encapsulated together.  
**Found in line no.** - 5–8, 10–15, 19–22  
**Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object  
**Possible solution** - Create an Employee class to encapsulate all employee-related data, simplifying data management and improving code clarity.

---

### 4. Code smell no. - 4  
**Code smell name** - Long Parameter List  
**Code smell description** - The constructor for `TeachingStaffBad` takes multiple parameters, leading to potential errors and reduced readability.  
**Found in line no.** - 10–15  
**Possible treatments** - Replace Parameter with Method Call, Preserve Whole Object, Introduce Parameter Object  
**Possible solution** - Use a data object or builder pattern to pass employee details, reducing parameter clutter.

---

### 5. Code smell no. - 5  
**Code smell name** - Comments  
**Code smell description** - There are no comments to explain the purpose or reasoning behind certain logic portions, like salary setting or validation.  
**Found in line no.** - 10–15, 25–35, 37–41, 46–50  
**Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion  
**Possible solution** - Add meaningful comments, rename methods to self-explanatory names, or extract parts of logic into clearly named methods to improve understanding.

**Summary**:  
The code exhibits Primitive Obsession, Long Methods, Data Clumps, and potential for better encapsulation and polymorphism. Refactoring through introducing enums or class hierarchy for employee types, encapsulating employee data into dedicated classes, and replacing lengthy conditional logic with polymorphic behavior would significantly improve its structure and maintainability.
