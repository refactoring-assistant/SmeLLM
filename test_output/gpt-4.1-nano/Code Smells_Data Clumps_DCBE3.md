**Code Review: DCBE3.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code relies heavily on primitive data types (double) for core properties, which leads to duplicated logic and potential errors. Use of specific classes or value objects would improve clarity and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 35, 48
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Create dedicated classes for financial quantities such as Principal, Rate, and Time to encapsulate related data and behavior.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Duplicated Code
- Code smell description - Similar logic for calculating interests is duplicated across different classes, specifically in SimpleLoanValuesBad and CompoundLoanValuesBad, which both instantiate InterestCalculatorBad to perform calculations.
- Found in line no. - 35, 48
- Possible treatments - Extract Method & Pull Up Field, Extract Superclass
- Possible solution - Extract common interest calculation method in a superclass or create an interest calculation strategy pattern to remove duplication.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The AbstractLoanValuesBad class manages multiple concerns such as storing data, printing details, and calculating interest, making it rather large and potentially complex.
- Found in line no. - 5 to 26
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- Possible solution - Separate printing logic into a dedicated class or use a decorator to handle presentation concerns, reducing complexity of the core class.
