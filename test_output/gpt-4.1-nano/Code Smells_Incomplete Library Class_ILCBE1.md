**Code Review: ILCBE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code directly uses long primitive values to represent days in milliseconds, which reduces readability and increases risk of errors.
- **Found in line no.** - 5, 38, 40
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Array with Object
- **Possible solution** - Create a `Duration` or `TimeSpan` class to encapsulate time units, replacing arbitrary long constants with meaningful objects.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - The methods `changeDayToNextDay()`, `changeDayToPreviousDay()`, `isGivenDateNextDay()`, and `isGivenDatePreviousDay()` contain multiple statements, making them complex and harder to maintain.
- **Found in line no.** - 10-12, 14-16, 18-21, 23-26
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution** - Break these methods into smaller, well-named methods to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Mutable Date Object
- **Code smell description** - Usage of mutable `java.util.Date` leads to potential bugs because the date object can be altered unexpectedly.
- **Found in line no.** - 4, 11, 15, 19, 24, 28
- **Possible treatments** - Encapsulate Field, Replace Data Value with Object
- **Possible solution** - Use `java.time.LocalDate` or other immutable date/time classes from Java 8+ to ensure immutability and safer handling.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Duplicate Code
- **Code smell description** - Similar code for calculating next and previous days is repeated, which can lead to inconsistencies and maintenance issues.
- **Found in line no.** - 19-20, 24-25
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Consolidate Conditional Expression and use Extract Method
- **Possible solution** - Create a method `getAdjacentDay(Date baseDate, long offset)` to compute next or previous date, reducing duplication.

- **Code smell no.** - 5
- **Code smell name** - Long Parameter List
- **Code smell description** - Several methods receive `Date` objects as parameters; however, these could be encapsulated or passed as part of an object.
- **Found in line no.** - 18, 23
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Parameter with Method Call, Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution** - Pass a context object encapsulating related data, or consider redesigning to avoid passing multiple parameters.

This code contains significant issues primarily with date handling, duplication, and the use of primitive types for time calculations. Refactoring with immutable types, abstractions for time durations, and smaller methods would greatly enhance clarity and robustness.
