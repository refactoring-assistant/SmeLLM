**Code Review: LMGE2.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class LawsOfMotionGood contains multiple methods and calculations, handling physics computations and output, which makes it a large, complex class. This can hinder maintainability and clarity.
- Found in line no. - 1, 11, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- Possible solution - Refactor by dividing LawsOfMotionGood into smaller classes such as MotionCalculator, PhysicsConstants, and OutputHandler, enabling better separation of concerns.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code uses primitive data types (double, int) where more meaningful or encapsulated types could improve clarity and safety.
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 11, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object
- Possible solution - Create value objects such as Displacement, Velocity, Mass, and Time, to encapsulate related data and enhance type safety.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The method calculateAllMotion performs multiple distinct calculations and print statements, making it lengthy and harder to understand or modify.
- Found in line no. - 11
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- Possible solution - Break down calculateAllMotion into smaller methods like displayVelocity, displayDisplacement, etc., each focused on a single task.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Several parameters such as mass and time appear together in method signatures, indicating they should be encapsulated into a single object.
- Found in line no. - 11, 34, 42, 46
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object
- Possible solution - Create a class MotionParameters that includes mass and time, and pass it to relevant methods.

Overall, the code displays signs of Large Class, Primitive Obsession, Long Method, and Data Clumps. Applying the recommended treatments would improve maintainability, readability, and design quality.
