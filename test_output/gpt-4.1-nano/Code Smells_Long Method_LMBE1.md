# Code Review: LMBE1.java
- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code heavily relies on primitive data types (String, int, float, Date) to model domain concepts, which is not ideal. For example, card number, CVV, status, and standing could be encapsulated into dedicated value objects for better clarity, validation, and maintainability.
- **Found in line no.** - 22-38, 40-67, 69-121
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution** - Introduce domain-specific value objects such as `CardNumber`, `CVV`, `TransactionStatus`, `CardStatus`, `Standing`. This encapsulates validation and behavior related to these data elements, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.
