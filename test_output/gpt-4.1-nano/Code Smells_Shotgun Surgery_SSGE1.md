**Code Review: SSGE1.java**
- **Code smell no.** 1
- **Code smell name:** Large Class
- **Code smell description:** The class `SubjectsGradingGood` contains multiple responsibilities such as storing the grade, setting the grade, and checking the grade, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Found in line no.:** 2-24
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- **Possible solution:** Refactor `SubjectsGradingGood` into separate classes: one for grade management, another for grade interpretation, to improve maintainability and clarity.

- **Code smell no.** 2
- **Code smell name:** Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description:** Use of `char` to represent grades is a primitive data type that can be error-prone and inflexible.
- **Found in line no.:** 2, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 23, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36
- **Possible treatments:** Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class
- **Possible solution:** Define an enum `Grade` to represent grades, replacing `char` and making code more type-safe.

- **Code smell no.** 3
- **Code smell name:** Long Method
- **Code smell description:** The method `setGradeBasedOnMarks` contains multiple conditional branches, making it lengthy and difficult to maintain.
- **Found in line no.:** 8-20
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution:** Break down the method into smaller methods such as `getGradeForMarks` to improve readability.

- **Code smell no.** 4
- **Code smell name:** Switch Statements
- **Code smell description:** The `checkGrade` method uses multiple `if-else` conditions to determine output, which could be replaced with polymorphism.
- **Found in line no.:** 27-39
- **Possible treatments:** Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- **Possible solution:** Use a `Grade` enum with an associated description to simplify grade interpretation.

- **Code smell no.** 5
- **Code smell name:** Duplicate Code
- **Code smell description:** Classes `MathClassGood` and `EnglishClassGood` have identical structure and methods related to grading.
- **Found in line no.:** 42-72
- **Possible treatments:** Extract Class
- **Possible solution:** Create a generic `SubjectClass` with parameterized subject name, or use inheritance to reduce duplication.

- **Code smell no.** 6
- **Code smell name:** Comments
- **Code smell description:** None detected; code is relatively self-explanatory.
- **Found in line no.:** None
- **Possible treatments:** None
- **Possible solution:** None

**Summary:** The primary issues include a large class that manages multiple responsibilities, primitive usage for grades, lengthy methods with conditional logic, duplicated classes for each subject, and no comments. Refactoring to apply abstractions, using enums, and consolidating common code will improve the design.
