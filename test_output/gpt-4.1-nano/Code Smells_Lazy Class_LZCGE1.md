**Code Review: LZCGE1.java**

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code uses primitive types (int[][]) directly for matrices, which can lead to duplicated code and difficulty in maintaining matrix-related operations.
- **Found in line no.** - 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, 49, 55, 56
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object, Replace Array with Object
- **Possible solution** - Create a `Matrix` class to encapsulate matrix data and operations, replacing raw `int[][]` arrays; this improves code maintainability and clarity.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - The `performAddSubtractOperation` method performs multiple operations within nested loops, mixing logic and control flow leading to decreased readability.
- **Found in line no.** - 36
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution** - Break down `performAddSubtractOperation` into smaller methods like `addValues` and `subtractValues`; enhance clarity and maintainability.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Switch Statements (In this context, if replaced with if-else, might be cleaner)
- **Code smell description** - Usage of `if-else` for operation differentiation could be replaced by polymorphism for better scalability.
- **Found in line no.** - 39, 41
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- **Possible solution** - Implement `Operation` interface with `AddOperation` and `SubtractOperation` classes; `performAddSubtractOperation` would then invoke the operation object.

---

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Commented or TODO code
- **Code smell description** - Not applicable; no visible comments indicating unnecessary or distracting comments.
- **Found in line no.** - None
- **Possible treatments** - None
- **Possible solution** - No issues detected; the code is clean regarding comments.

---

**Summary:**  
The main issues are Primitive Obsession with raw arrays encapsulated into a `Matrix` class and a Long Method in `performAddSubtractOperation`. Applying the suggested treatments would improve code clarity, encapsulation, and maintainability.
