**Code Review: ILCGE1.java**
- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The code uses primitive data types (`long`) and raw `Date` objects to represent days, which can lead to error-prone code and lack of semantic clarity.
- **Found in line no.** - 5, 42, 44
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Array with Object
- **Possible solution** - Encapsulate date and calendar logic within a dedicated `Day` class, thereby removing direct reliance on primitive types and `Date` objects.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Shotgun Surgery
- **Code smell description** - Multiple methods (`changeDayToNextDay`, `changeDayToPreviousDay`, `isGivenDateNextDay`, `isGivenDatePreviousDay`) depend on similar logic related to date calculations, which can be consolidated to reduce maintenance overhead.
- **Found in line no.** - 10, 14, 18, 23
- **Possible treatments** - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Method & then Move Method
- **Possible solution** - Create a generalized method such as `calculateAdjacentDate(int offset)` to handle both next and previous day calculations, reducing duplicated code.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - Methods like `isGivenDateNextDay` and `isGivenDatePreviousDay` contain straightforward but somewhat verbose logic that could be extracted for clarity and reuse.
- **Found in line no.** - 18, 23
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query
- **Possible solution** - Extract common comparison logic into helper methods to clarify intent and simplify unit testing.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Data Clumps
- **Code smell description** - The code passes around related data points such as `defaultDay`, `aheadDate`, `prevDate` as separate `Date` instances, which indicates potential for grouping.
- **Found in line no.** - 42, 44
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- **Possible solution** - Create a `DayDescriptor` object that encapsulates date-related information such as the current date, next day, and previous day.

- **Code smell no.** - 5
- **Code smell name** - Comments
- **Code smell description** - The comments provided are minimal, and variable names could be more expressive to better communicate intent.
- **Found in line no.** - 36, 37, 38
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Variable, Rename Method
- **Possible solution** - Use descriptive variable/method names and avoid excessive commenting by writing self-explanatory code.

**Summary:**  
The code mainly suffers from Primitive Obsession, Shotgun Surgery, Long Methods, and Data Clumps. Refactoring to introduce domain-specific objects and consolidating repetitive logic can significantly improve maintainability and clarity.
