**Code Review: LPLGE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 1  
- Code smell name - Data Class  
- Code smell description - Classes that only contain fields, getters, and setters with no significant behavior or logic are considered data classes. They tend to propagate duplicated code and violate encapsulation principles.  
- Found in line no. - 18, 19, 20, 21, 36, 37, 38, 39  
- Possible treatments - Encapsulate Field, Encapsulate Collection, Move Method and Extract Method, Remove Setting Method and Hide Method  
- Possible solution - Refactor the classes to add meaningful behavior or combine data classes with behavior into richer domain objects to reduce data-only structures.  

- Code smell no. - 2  
- Code smell name - Long Method  
- Code smell description - Methods that perform multiple tasks or are excessively long can be difficult to understand and maintain.  
- Found in line no. - 13, 31, 49  
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional, Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object  
- Possible solution - Split the large getDetails methods into smaller, focused methods that handle individual parts of the data presentation, e.g., formatAccountDetails(), formatAddressDetails().  

- Code smell no. - 3  
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Encapsulation / Primitive Obsession  
- Code smell description - Using primitive types like String or int for complex concepts such as address or account details instead of dedicated classes leads to poor encapsulation and potential bugs.  
- Found in line no. - 18-21, 36-39  
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Encapsulate Collection, Introduce Parameter Object  
- Possible solution - Already applied by using AddressGood and BankAccountGood classes, but ensure all complex data handling is properly encapsulated and only accessed via methods, not directly.

No other significant code smells detected.
