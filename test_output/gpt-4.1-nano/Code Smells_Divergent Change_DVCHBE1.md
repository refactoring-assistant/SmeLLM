# Code Review: DVCHBE1.java

- **Code smell no.** - 1
- **Code smell name** - Long Method
- **Code smell description** - Several methods (add2Matrix, subtract2Matrix, multiply2Matrix, perform_add_subtract) contain multiple nested loops and conditional logic, making them lengthy and complex.
- **Found in line no.** - 14, 23, 31, 50
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- **Possible solution** - Break down large methods into smaller, focused methods to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Code smell no.** - 2
- **Code smell name** - Primitive Obsession
- **Code smell description** - The use of raw `String` literals ("ADD", "SUBTRACT") to specify operations suggests primitive obsession; better to use enums.
- **Found in line no.** - 50, 53, 54, 57, 60
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
- **Possible solution** - Use an enum for operation types to clarify intent and avoid string comparisons.

- **Code smell no.** - 3
- **Code smell name** - Switch Statements
- **Code smell description** - The presence of a switch statement (line 53) based on string literals indicates a switch statement smell; replaces with polymorphism or strategy pattern for better extensibility.
- **Found in line no.** - 53
- **Possible treatments** - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- **Possible solution** - Refactor the switch statement into a hierarchy of classes implementing a common interface for operations.

- **Code smell no.** - 4
- **Code smell name** - Data Clumps
- **Code smell description** - The matrix dimensions are repeatedly accessed and passed around; encapsulate matrix properties into a class.
- **Found in line no.** - 11, 33, 34, 52, 53
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object
- **Possible solution** - Create a `Matrix` class encapsulating the data and dimensions to reduce repeated data access.

---

- **Code smell no.** - 5
- **Code smell name** - Large Class
- **Code smell description** - The class `SquareMatrixOperationsBad` performs multiple unrelated operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, leading to a large, unfocused class.
- **Found in line no.** - 3 to 67
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Class, Extract Interface
- **Possible solution** - Separate matrix operations into dedicated classes for Add, Subtract, Multiply operations.

---

- **Code smell no.** - 6
- **Code smell name** - Comments
- **Code smell description** - The code contains minimal comments, making understanding and maintenance harder.
- **Found in line no.** - 14, 23, 31, 50, 65
- **Possible treatments** - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- **Possible solution** - Add meaningful comments to clarify complex sections and logic.

**Summary:**  
The code exhibits issues related to large methods, primitive obsession via string constants, use of switch statements, and possible data clumps. Restructuring into smaller classes and replacing string-based control logic with polymorphic solutions would greatly enhance maintainability and clarity.
