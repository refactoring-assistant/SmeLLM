**Code Review: RBBE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Interface Segregation Principle Violation
- Code smell description - The interface `NoteTakerBad` enforces implementing classes to define methods they do not support, leading to unsupported operation exceptions.
- Found in line no. - 6, 18
- Possible treatments - Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy, Extract Interface
- Possible solution - Refactor the design to create separate interfaces for supported functionalities, e.g., `WritableNotes` and `ShareableNotes`, and have classes implement only what they support, thus adhering to the interface segregation principle.
