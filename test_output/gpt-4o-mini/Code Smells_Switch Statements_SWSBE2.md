**Code Review: SWSBE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Switch Statements
- Code smell description - The switch statement is used to execute different parts of the code based on the value of routeType, leading to a violation of the Open/Closed Principle.
- Found in line no. - 13
- Possible treatments - [Extract Method & then Move Method, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods, Introduce Null Object]
- Possible solution - Refactor the `calculateTimeToDestination` method by replacing the switch statement with a polymorphic approach using subclasses, where each route type (CAR, BIKE, WALK, BUS) has its own implementation of a `calculateTime` method.

```java
interface Route {
    void calculateTime();
}

class CarRoute implements Route {
    public void calculateTime() {
        System.out.println("Time to destination by car: 30 minutes");
    }
}

class BikeRoute implements Route {
    public void calculateTime() {
        System.out.println("Time to destination by bike: 45 minutes");
    }
}

class WalkRoute implements Route {
    public void calculateTime() {
        System.out.println("Time to destination by walk: 2 hours");
    }
}

class BusRoute implements Route {
    public void calculateTime() {
        System.out.println("Time to destination by bus: 1 hour");
    }
}

class UserRouteBad implements RouteBad {
    private Route route;

    @Override
    public void calculateTimeToDestination() {
        if (route != null) {
            route.calculateTime();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setRouteType(RouteTypeBad routeType) {
        switch (routeType) {
            case CAR:
                route = new CarRoute();
                break;
            case BIKE:
                route = new BikeRoute();
                break;
            case WALK:
                route = new WalkRoute();
                break;
            case BUS:
                route = new BusRoute();
                break;
        }
    }
}
```
