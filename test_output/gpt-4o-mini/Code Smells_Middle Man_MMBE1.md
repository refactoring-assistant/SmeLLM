- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class contains multiple responsibilities and is too lengthy, making it difficult to maintain and understand.
- Found in line no. - ~7~, ~42~, ~61~, ~86~
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data
- Possible solution - Split the FactorySupervisorBad, FactoryBad, and FactoryWorkerBad into separate files and ensure each class has a single responsibility.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Feature Envy
- Code smell description - Certain methods in one class rely more heavily on methods and data of another class, indicating potential misplacements of functionalities.
- Found in line no. - ~31~, ~83~
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method, Extract Method with Move Method
- Possible solution - Move the `getName()` method from FactoryWorkerBad to where it can be utilized more appropriately within a context that requires worker identity, such as in FactorySupervisorBad.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - The method 'getName' in FactoryWorkerBad has no return and only prints the name, which is not useful as a getter.

- Possible treatments - Remove Unused Code, Remove Parameter
- Possible solution - Change the `getName()` method to return the name instead of printing it, or simply remove the method if not needed.
