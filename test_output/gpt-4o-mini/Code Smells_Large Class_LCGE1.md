**Code Review: LCGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - A class that has too many responsibilities or members (fields/methods) and can be divided into smaller, more focused classes.
- Found in line no. - 101
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
- Possible solution - Refactor the `LCGE1` class by extracting its main functionality into separate classes, for example, `Application`, separating concerns of initializing and managing the `IPerson`, `IAddress`, and `IBankAccount`.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Groups of data items that are frequently used together can be better encapsulated in their own object.
- Found in line no. - 19-22, 44-46, 74-77
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - Create a `PersonDetails` class to encapsulate first name and last name, a `BankAccountDetails` class to encapsulate bank account details, and an `AddressDetails` class for address information.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Using primitive data types to represent domain concepts instead of creating a proper object.
- Found in line no. - 19-22, 44-46, 74-77
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Instead of using `String` for `street`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, `bankAccountNumber`, etc., create dedicated classes like `Address`, `BankAccount`, and encapsulate associated fields.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - Code that relies heavily on comments instead of clear code structures or methods to explain intent. 
- Found in line no. - N/A (though not explicitly shown, methods could be simplified)
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Variable', 'Extract Method', 'Rename Method', 'Introduce Assertion']
- Possible solution - Instead of comments explaining methods or fields, rename classes and methods more descriptively to clearly convey function, or extract smaller methods for clarity.

In summary, refactoring the class to reduce its size and encapsulate related data into new classes would improve the design significantly.
