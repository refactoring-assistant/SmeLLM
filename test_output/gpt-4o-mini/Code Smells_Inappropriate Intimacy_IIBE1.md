**Code Review: IIBE1.java**
    - Code smell no. - 1
    - Code smell name - Large Class
    - Code smell description - The class has too many responsibilities and might be better split into smaller, more focused classes.
    - Found in line no. - ~6~, ~29~, ~47~
    - Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
    - Possible solution - Separate the responsibilities of SubjectMarksBad into distinct classes for managing marks and grade scales, and potentially provide an interface for subject-specific functionality.

    - Code smell no. - 2
    - Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
    - Code smell description - The use of primitive types (like int and Character) instead of more expressive types or objects for handling grades and marks.
    - Found in line no. - ~7~, ~20~, ~25~
    - Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
    - Possible solution - Create a Grade class that encapsulates the grade logic and the marks could be encapsulated in a Marks class that holds both value and related operations.

    - Code smell no. - 3
    - Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
    - Code smell description - Classes are too tightly coupled; for example, TeacherBad has direct access to EnglishBad's internal state.
    - Found in line no. - ~48~, ~58~
    - Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', 'Replace Delegation with Inheritance']
    - Possible solution - Provide public methods in the EnglishBad class that manage its marks internally without exposing its fields directly, improving encapsulation.

    - Code smell no. - 4
    - Code smell name - Feature Envy
    - Code smell description - Methods in one class (TeacherBad) are more interested in the fields of another class (EnglishBad).
    - Found in line no. - ~56~, ~58~
    - Possible treatments - ['Move Method', 'Extract Method', 'Extract Method with Move Method']
    - Possible solution - Move the functionality for setting marks inside EnglishBad, so that TeacherBad simply calls a method like `englishSubject.setMarks(85)`.

    - Code smell no. - 5
    - Code smell name - Dead Code
    - Code smell description - Unused or redundant code that doesnâ€™t contribute to the program's functionality.
    - Found in line no. - ~41~, ~44~
    - Possible treatments - ['Remove Unused Code', 'Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy', 'Remove Parameter']
    - Possible solution - Remove any commented or placeholder methods that do not serve a purpose or are not implemented.
