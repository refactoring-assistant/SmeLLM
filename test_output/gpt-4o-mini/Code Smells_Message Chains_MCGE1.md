**Code Review: MCGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - A class that has too many responsibilities or too much data, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 4, 20, 40, 77, 94
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data.
- Possible solution - Split each class into smaller classes with single responsibilities. For example, create a separate class to handle order details and management, and another for handling person data independently.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - A method that exceeds a certain length and becomes difficult to understand.
- Found in line no. - 59
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments.
- Possible solution - The `placeOrder()` method can be extracted into smaller methods to separate the logic of placing an order and notifying the user.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types to represent concepts that could be better represented by classes.
- Found in line no. - 42, 46, 52, 80
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Introduce Parameter Object.
- Possible solution - Create a class for `OrderNumber` and `OrderStatus` to better encapsulate their behavior and responsibilities.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Feature Envy
- Code smell description - A class that is more interested in the methods of another class than its own.
- Found in line no. - 72, 73
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method.
- Possible solution - Move the `getAddress()` and `getName()` method calls directly into a dedicated method within the `OrderGood` class rather than relying too heavily on `PersonGood` to provide that information.

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - Code that is never executed or is impossible to reach.
- Found in line no. - None
- Possible treatments - Remove Unused Code, Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy, Remove Parameter.
- Possible solution - Regular code review to ensure all methods and classes are utilized and remove any that are not applicable or necessary.

Overall, the classes could be broken down into smaller, more focused units that adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle for clearer cohesion and less dependency between classes.
