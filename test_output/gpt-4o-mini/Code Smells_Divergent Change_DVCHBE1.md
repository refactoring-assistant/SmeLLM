**Code Review: DVCHBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class is responsible for too many operations related to matrix handling, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- Found in line no. - ~3~, ~4~, ~5~, ~6~, ~8~, ~14~, ~23~, ~31~, ~50~ 
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - Methods like `add2Matrix`, `subtract2Matrix`, and `multiply2Matrix` are overly long and could be broken down into smaller methods.
- Found in line no. - ~14~, ~23~, ~31~
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Switch Statements
- Code smell description - The method `perform_add_subtract` uses a switch statement that can be simplified by employing polymorphism or other structure.
- Found in line no. - ~53~
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method & then Move Method', 'Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Conditional with Polymorphism', 'Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods', 'Introduce Null Object']

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The operations in `perform_add_subtract` rely on a string to determine the operation, which could be replaced with an enum or strategy pattern.
- Found in line no. - ~8~, ~50~
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Feature Envy
- Code smell description - The methods reference the `result` matrix directly and can be improved by moving the calculation logics to the caller or encapsulating it better.
- Found in line no. - ~17~, ~26~, ~45~
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method', 'Extract Method', 'Extract Method with Move Method']

- Code smell no. - 6
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The methods are tightly coupled to the internal representation of the matrices, making changes risky.
- Found in line no. - ~4~, ~5~, ~6~
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', 'Replace Delegation with Inheritance']

**Possible Solution:**
```java
class Matrix {
    private int[][] data;

    public Matrix(int[][] data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public int[][] getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public Matrix add(Matrix other) {
        // Implementation of addition
    }

    public Matrix subtract(Matrix other) {
        // Implementation of subtraction
    }

    public Matrix multiply(Matrix other) {
        // Implementation of multiplication
    }
}

public class DVCHBE1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Matrix matrix1 = new Matrix(new int[][]{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}});
        Matrix matrix2 = new Matrix(new int[][]{{9, 8, 7}, {6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1}});
        
        Matrix resultAdd = matrix1.add(matrix2);
        Matrix resultSubtract = matrix1.subtract(matrix2);
        Matrix resultMultiply = matrix1.multiply(matrix2);
    }
}
```
