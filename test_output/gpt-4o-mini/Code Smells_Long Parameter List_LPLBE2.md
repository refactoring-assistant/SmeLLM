**Code Review: LPLBE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - A method that is excessively long and difficult to understand or follow.
- Found in line no. - 70
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Replace Parameter with Method Call
- Possible solution - 
```java
public double calculateCartPrice(Map<String, Double> priceList, double storeDiscount, double memberDiscount, double tax, double fees) {
    double totalPrice = 0;
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : productsBought.entrySet()) {
        totalPrice += calculateProductPrice(entry, priceList);
    }
    return finalizeTotalPrice(totalPrice, storeDiscount, memberDiscount, tax, fees);
}

private double calculateProductPrice(Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry, Map<String, Double> priceList) {
    String product = entry.getKey();
    int quantity = entry.getValue();
    double price = priceList.get(product);
    return price * quantity;
}

private double finalizeTotalPrice(double totalPrice, double storeDiscount, double memberDiscount, double tax, double fees) {
    return totalPrice * (1 - storeDiscount) * (1 - memberDiscount) * (1 + tax) + fees;
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Parameter List
- Code smell description - A method that takes a long list of parameters, making it harder to understand and use correctly.
- Found in line no. - 70
- Possible treatments - Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - 
```java
class PricingDetails {
    double storeDiscount;
    double memberDiscount;
    double tax;
    double fees;

    public PricingDetails(double storeDiscount, double memberDiscount, double tax, double fees) {
        this.storeDiscount = storeDiscount;
        this.memberDiscount = memberDiscount;
        this.tax = tax;
        this.fees = fees;
    }
}

public double calculateCartPrice(Map<String, Double> priceList, PricingDetails pricingDetails) {
    double totalPrice = 0;
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : productsBought.entrySet()) {
        totalPrice += calculateProductPrice(entry, priceList);
    }
    return finalizeTotalPrice(totalPrice, pricingDetails);
}

private double finalizeTotalPrice(double totalPrice, PricingDetails pricingDetails) {
    return totalPrice * (1 - pricingDetails.storeDiscount) * (1 - pricingDetails.memberDiscount) * (1 + pricingDetails.tax) + pricingDetails.fees;
}
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Certain data items seem to be grouped together because they are always used together.
- Found in line no. - 70
- Possible treatments - Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - As shown in the solution provided for "Long Parameter List." 

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types to represent concepts that could be better represented using an object.
- Found in line no. - 5, 6, 28, 29
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Discount {
    private final double value;

    public Discount(double value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public double getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}

class Fees {
    private final double amount;

    public Fees(double amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }
}

// And similarly use these objects in StoreMemberPricingBad and StorePricingBad classes
```
