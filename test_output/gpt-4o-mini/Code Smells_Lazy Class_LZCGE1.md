**Code Review: LZCGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - This method is too long and does multiple things which reduces its readability and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 36
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
- Possible solution - 
```java
private void performAddSubtractOperation(OperationGood operation) {
    for (int i = 0; i < matrix1.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < matrix1[0].length; j++) {
            performOperation(operation, i, j);
        }
    }
}

private void performOperation(OperationGood operation, int i, int j) {
    if (operation.equals(OperationGood.ADD)) {
        result[i][j] = matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j];
    } else if (operation.equals(OperationGood.SUBTRACT)) {
        result[i][j] = matrix1[i][j] - matrix2[i][j];
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive array data types for matrix representation could benefit from encapsulation in a specialized class.
- Found in line no. - 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 22, 24, 36
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Matrix {
    private final int[][] data;

    public Matrix(int[][] data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public int get(int row, int column) {
        return data[row][column];
    }

    public void set(int row, int column, int value) {
        data[row][column] = value;
    }

    public int getRowCount() {
        return data.length;
    }

    public int getColumnCount() {
        return data[0].length;
    }
}
```
Then modify `MatrixOperationGood` to use the `Matrix` class instead of `int[][]`.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - The `MatrixOperationGood` class groups matrix1, matrix2, and result together, which could be encapsulated in a single `Matrix` class.
- Found in line no. - 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 22, 24
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - Implement the `Matrix` class above and pass `Matrix` objects into the `MatrixOperationGood` constructor.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - The code lacks comments for clarity, making it challenging to understand the purpose of methods at a glance.
- Found in line no. - 10, 20, 23, 28, 36, 48
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Variable', 'Extract Method', 'Rename Method', 'Introduce Assertion']
- Possible solution - Add comments throughout the class to explain complex logic and methods:
```java
// Constructor: Initializes matrix operations 
// with provided matrices if dimensions are compatible.
```
```java
// Performs addition or subtraction based on operation type
```
```java
// Checks compatibility of matrices for operation
```
```java
// Prints the resulting matrix in a readable format
```

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - There is no dead code in the provided snippet; all methods serve a purpose.
- Found in line no. - None
- Possible treatments - ['Remove Unused Code', 'Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy', 'Remove Parameter']
- Possible solution - No action needed as no dead code was found.
