**Code Review: PIHBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code uses primitive data types (String) to represent key concepts (e.g., `model`, `engineType`, `factoryName`) instead of encapsulating them in their own classes.
- Found in line no. - 13, 14, 34
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - 
```java
// Possible implementation of model and engine types as separate classes

class VehicleModel {
    private final String model;

    public VehicleModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
    
    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }
}

class EngineType {
    private final String type;

    public EngineType(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public String getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

abstract class AbstractVehicleBad implements VehicleBad {
    private VehicleModel model;
    private EngineType engineType;
    protected VehicleFactoryBad factory;

    public AbstractVehicleBad(VehicleModel model, EngineType engineType) {
        this.model = model;
        this.engineType = engineType;
    }

    public void printVehicleInfo() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model.getModel() + ", Engine Type: " + engineType.getType());
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class `AbstractVehicleBad` has multiple responsibilities (i.e., vehicle attributes and factory handling), leading to a lack of cohesion.
- Found in line no. - 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 27
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface
- Possible solution - 
```java
// Divide responsibilities between Vehicle and Factory
abstract class Vehicle {
    protected VehicleFactoryBad factory;

    public abstract void printVehicleInfo();
}

class AbstractVehicleBad extends Vehicle implements VehicleBad {
    private VehicleModel model;
    private EngineType engineType;

    public AbstractVehicleBad(VehicleModel model, EngineType engineType) {
        this.model = model;
        this.engineType = engineType;
    }

    @Override
    public void printVehicleInfo() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model.getModel() + ", Engine Type: " + engineType.getType());
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The classes `CarBad` and `BikeBad` have an inappropriate intimacy with `CarFactoryBad` and `BikeFactoryBad`, respectively, relying on specific factory implementations.
- Found in line no. - 46, 77
- Possible treatments - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Class & Hide Delegate
- Possible solution - 
```java
// Use polymorphism to avoid direct dependency on specific factory implementations
abstract class AbstractVehicleBad {
    protected VehicleFactoryBad factory;

    protected void setProductionFacility(VehicleFactoryBad factory) {
        this.factory = factory;
    }
}

class CarBad extends AbstractVehicleBad {
    public CarBad(VehicleModel model, EngineType engineType) {
        super(model, engineType);
        setProductionFacility(new CarFactoryBad("Default " + model.getModel() + " Factory"));
    }
}

// Similarly for BikeBad
```
