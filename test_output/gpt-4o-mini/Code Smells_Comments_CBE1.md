class Order {
    private int orderID;
    private String orderName;
    private double orderAmount;
    private double discount;
    private double tax;
    private String orderStatus;

        this.orderID = orderID;
        this.orderName = orderName;
        this.discount = 0.15;
        this.tax = 0.1;
        this.orderStatus = orderStatus;
    }

    public void solve(int numItems , double perItemCost) {
        orderAmount = (numItems * perItemCost) * (1 - discount) * (1 + tax);
    }

    public void printOrderDetails() {
        System.out.println("Order ID: " + orderID);
        System.out.println("Order Name: " + orderName);
        System.out.println("Order Amount: " + Math.round(orderAmount));
        System.out.println("Order Status: " + orderStatus);
    }
}
```
```java
class CBE1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Order order = new Order(1, "Laptop", "confirmed");
        order.solve(2, 500);
        order.printOrderDetails();
    }

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - Comments explaining what the code does, which may indicate that the code itself is not clear enough.
- Found in line no. - 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24
- Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion.
- Possible solution - The comments can be removed if the method names and variable names are expressive enough or they could be replaced with meaningful method names that convey the functionality.

```java
public void calculateOrderAmount(int numItems, double perItemCost) {
    orderAmount = (numItems * perItemCost) * (1 - discount) * (1 + tax);
}
```
This solution reduces the need for comments by enhancing the clarity of the code itself.
