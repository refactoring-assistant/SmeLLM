- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Class
- Code smell description - A class that only contains data without providing meaningful behavior can be considered a data class.
- Found in line no. - 5-7
- Possible treatments - Encapsulate Field
- Possible solution - 
```java
public class TeachingStaffGood implements StaffGood {
    private String empName;
    private String empId;
    private double salary;

    // Existing constructor and methods...
    
    public String getEmpName() {
        return empName;
    }

    public String getEmpId() {
        return empId;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Using primitive data types to represent domain ideas creates problems, especially when the data could be represented as a proper class.
- Found in line no. - 5-7
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object
- Possible solution - 
```java
class EmployeeId {
    private String id;

    public EmployeeId(String id) {
        if (id.length() != 6) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid employee id");
        }
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
}

// Usage in TeachingStaffGood
private EmployeeId empId;

// Constructor would then accept EmployeeId instead of String
```

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Duplicate Code
- Code smell description - Having similar code in multiple places can lead to maintenance issues and bugs when a change is required.
- Found in line no. - 28-29, 50-65, 82-83
- Possible treatments - Extract Method
- Possible solution - 
```java
protected void printEmployeeType() {
    printType();
}

private void printType(String type) {
    System.out.println("Employee Type: " + type);
}
// Then you'd use printType("Professor") etc. in the subclasses.
```

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Lazy Class
- Code smell description - A class that is not doing enough to be worth its own existence.
- Found in line no. - 38, 54, 70 
- Possible treatments - Inline Class
- Possible solution - Instead of having separate classes for each type of professor, consider using an enum or a strategy pattern to define behavior without multiple classes for each professor type.
