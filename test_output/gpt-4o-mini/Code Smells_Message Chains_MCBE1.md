**Code Review: MCBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - A class that is trying to do too much and has too many responsibilities, making it hard to maintain and understand.
- Found in line no. - ~4~, ~20~, ~40~, ~79~
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data.
- Possible solution - Split the large classes `OrderBad`, `PersonBad`, and `AddressBad` into smaller, more focused classes that better encapsulate their respective functionality.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Using primitive data types to represent domain ideas. Instead, using objects can help in better understanding and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - ~41~, ~42~, ~44~, ~45~
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy.
- Possible solution - Create a separate class, e.g., `OrderStatus` to encapsulate the order status, and `OrderTotal` for managing order totals instead of using primitive types directly.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Feature Envy
- Code smell description - A method in one class is overly dependent on the methods and data of another class.
- Found in line no. - ~94~
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method, Extract Method with Move Method.
- Possible solution - Move the functionality for printing the Address from `OrderHistoryBad` to the `AddressBad` class itself, allowing it to handle its own string representation.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - A method that is too long and does too much, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
- Found in line no. - ~68~ to ~76~
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Decompose Conditional.
- Possible solution - Extract the printing logic inside `printOrderDetails` into a separate method that manages the display of order details.

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Duplicate Code
- Code smell description - Repeated code across methods or classes that should be consolidated.
- Found in line no. - ~94~ (Accessing person's address)
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Pull Up Field, Extract Superclass, Extract Class.
- Possible solution - Create a method in the `OrderBad` class to return the formatted address for a person, thus consolidating the code that accesses the `AddressBad` instance.

- Code smell no. - 6
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - Code is difficult to understand due to a lack of self-documentation or excessive comments which can indicate poorly structured code.
- Found in line no. - None
- Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion.
- Possible solution - Ensure method and variable names are more descriptive to eliminate the need for comments that explain the code's intent. All methods should convey purpose through their names.
