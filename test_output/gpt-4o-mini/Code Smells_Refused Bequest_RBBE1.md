**Code Review: RBBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class `ComputerBad` has multiple responsibilities with a lot of properties (brand, model, key, mouseDirection, switchedOn) and methods, which can make it harder to manage and understand.
- Found in line no. - 18
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data.
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Computer {
    protected String brand;
    protected String model;
    protected Character key;
    protected boolean switchedOn;
    
    public Computer(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.key = '\0';
        this.switchedOn = false;
    }
    public void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + " Model: " + model);
    }
    public void switchOnOff() {
        System.out.println(switchedOn ? turnOff() : turnOn());
    }
    public void clickKeyboard(Character clickedKey) {
        this.key = clickedKey;
        System.out.println("Clicked key: " + key);
    }
    private String turnOn() {
        switchedOn = true;
        return "Turning on.";
    }
    private String turnOff() {
        switchedOn = false;
        return "Turning off.";
    }
}

class Mouse {
    protected MouseDirectionBad direction;
    
    public void moveMouse(MouseDirectionBad direction) {
        this.direction = direction;
        System.out.println("Mouse moved to: " + direction.toString());
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code uses `Character` type to handle key clicks instead of a more meaningful class, which can help encapsulate the behavior related to keys.
- Found in line no. - 20, 21, 39, 63, 70
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy.
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Key {
    private char value;
    
    public Key(char value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.valueOf(value);
    }
}

// Update Computer and MobileBad classes accordingly
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The `MobileBad` class overrides methods from its parent class `ComputerBad` but does not implement any meaningful behavior, leading to wasted space and potentially confusing behavior.
- Found in line no. - 56, 61, 66
- Possible treatments - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Class & Hide Delegate, Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional, Replace Delegation with Inheritance.
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Mobile extends Computer {
    public Mobile(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    public void clickScreen(Key clickedKey) {
        this.key = clickedKey.getValue();
        System.out.println("Clicked screen at: " + key);
    }
}
```
