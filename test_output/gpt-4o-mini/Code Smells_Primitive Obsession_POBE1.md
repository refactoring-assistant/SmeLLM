**Code Review: POBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class HealthRecordBad contains numerous instance variables and methods, making it too large and complex to manage effectively.
- Found in line no. - 2
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data.
- Possible solution - 
```java
class PatientBasicInfo {
    private String patientIdentifier;
    private String[] patientName;
    private String[] patientAddress;
    private String insuranceNumber;
    
    public PatientBasicInfo(String patientIdentifier, String[] patientName, String[] patientAddress, String insuranceNumber) {
        this.patientIdentifier = patientIdentifier;
        this.patientName = patientName;
        this.patientAddress = patientAddress;
        this.insuranceNumber = insuranceNumber;
    }

    // getters and setters
}

class HealthRecord {
    private String bloodGroup = "N/A";
    private String height = "N/A";
    private String weight = "N/A";
    private String age = "N/A";
    private String[] previousMedication = new String[10];
    private String[] durationOfMedication = new String[10];
    private String[] allergies = new String[10];
    private String[] diseaseHistory = new String[10];
    private PatientBasicInfo patientInfo;

    public HealthRecord(PatientBasicInfo patientInfo) {
        this.patientInfo = patientInfo;
    }

    // methods from HealthRecordBad including updatePatientMedicalData and others
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive types (String arrays) for representing complex data such as patientName, patientAddress, and so on indicates an obsession with primitive data types instead of creating dedicated classes.
- Found in line no. - 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Array with Object.
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Address {
    private String[] address;

    public Address(String[] address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    // additional methods for Address handling
}

class Medication {
    private String name;
    private String duration;

    public Medication(String name, String duration) {
        this.name = name;
        this.duration = duration;
    }

    // additional methods for Medication handling
}
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Parameter List
- Code smell description - The constructor and some methods have too many parameters, making them difficult to read and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 16, 39, 53, 66
- Possible treatments - Replace Parameter with Method Call, Preserve Whole Object, Introduce Parameter Object.
- Possible solution - 
```java
public HealthRecord(PatientBasicInfo patientInfo) {
    this.patientInfo = patientInfo;
}

// Update methods to use PatientBasicInfo to retrieve patient details
```

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - The grouping of related data together (like patientName and patientAddress as arrays) is a sign that they should be encapsulated in their own classes.
- Found in line no. - 8, 9
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object.
- Possible solution - 
```java
class PatientBasicInfo {
    // implementation as suggested earlier for patientName and patientAddress
}
```

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Duplicate Code
- Code smell description - The verification of patient in methods like addPreviousMedication, addAllergy, and addDiseaseHistory is duplicated.
- Found in line no. - 40, 54, 68
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Extract Method & Pull Up Field, Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments.
- Possible solution - 
```java
private void checkPatientAndProceed(String patientIdentifier, Runnable action) {
    if (!verifyPatient(patientIdentifier)) {
        System.out.println("Patient not found");
        return;
    }
    action.run();
}

// Then in methods:
checkPatientAndProceed(patientIdentifier, () -> {
    // Logic for adding medication/allergy/disease here
});
```
