**Code Review: ILCBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - A method that exceeds a recommended length, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 10, 11, 14, 15, 28, 29
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Decompose Conditional.
- Possible solution - Refactor the methods `changeDayToNextDay` and `changeDayToPreviousDay` into private methods that encapsulate the logic for changing the day and then call these from the public methods.

```java
class TrackDayBad {
    private Date defaultDay;
    private static final long MILLIS_IN_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

    public TrackDayBad(Date defaultDay) {
        this.defaultDay = defaultDay;
    }

    public void changeDayToNextDay() {
        changeDayBy(MILLIS_IN_DAY);
    }

    public void changeDayToPreviousDay() {
        changeDayBy(-MILLIS_IN_DAY);
    }

    private void changeDayBy(long millis) {
        defaultDay.setTime(defaultDay.getTime() + millis);
    }

    public boolean isGivenDateNextDay(Date givenDate) {
        Date nextDay = new Date(defaultDay.getTime() + MILLIS_IN_DAY);
        return nextDay.compareTo(givenDate) == 0;
    }

    public boolean isGivenDatePreviousDay(Date givenDate) {
        Date prevDay = new Date(defaultDay.getTime() - MILLS_IN_DAY);
        return prevDay.compareTo(givenDate) == 0;
    }

    public void printDay() {
        System.out.println("Day: " + defaultDay.toString());
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Class
- Code smell description - A class that doesn't encapsulate behavior and only contains fields.
- Found in line no. - 3, 4, 5
- Possible treatments - Encapsulate Field, Encapsulate Collection, Move Method and Extract Method, Remove Setting Method and Hide Method.
- Possible solution - Create a `Day` class that encapsulates the logic related to a day, such as manipulating and comparing days, instead of having these methods directly in the `TrackDayBad` class.

```java
class Day {
    private Date date;
    
    public Day(Date date) {
        this.date = date;
    }

    public void changeDayBy(long millis) {
        date.setTime(date.getTime() + millis);
    }

    public boolean isNextDay(Date givenDate) {
        Date nextDay = new Date(date.getTime() + MILLIS_IN_DAY);
        return nextDay.compareTo(givenDate) == 0;
    }

    public boolean isPreviousDay(Date givenDate) {
        Date prevDay = new Date(date.getTime() - MILLIS_IN_DAY);
        return prevDay.compareTo(givenDate) == 0;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return date.toString();
    }
}
```

With this refactoring, methods are extracted into meaningful units, and the class responsibilities are clearer, improving maintainability and readability.
