**Code Review: LCGE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
- Code smell description - Two classes (PersonGood and StudentGood) are using similar interfaces but are not providing consistent method names or signatures.
- Found in line no. - 5
- Possible treatments - ['Rename Method', 'Move Method, Add Parameter & Parameterize Method', 'Extract Superclass']
- Possible solution - Consider refactoring the interfaces to include a common method that both classes implement, ensuring consistency in how details are printed. For example, modify IPersonGood to include a method `printDetails()` that both PersonGood and StudentGood would implement appropriately.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The StudentGood class relies heavily on PersonGood's implementation details and directly calls its method, leading to tightly coupled code.
- Found in line no. - 32
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', ' Replace Delegation with Inheritance']
- Possible solution - Modify printStudentDetails in StudentGood to not call printPersonDetails directly, but instead compose the output within its own method to reduce dependency on PersonGood.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Class
- Code smell description - The PersonGood class is mainly a data container for the name with no functionality beyond this.
- Found in line no. - 10
- Possible treatments - ['Encapsulate Field', 'Encapsulate Collection', 'Move Method and Extract Method', 'Remove Setting Method and Hide Method']
- Possible solution - Enhance the PersonGood class by introducing behavior related to its state or encapsulating the fields with getter and setter methods, ensuring a more robust implementation.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - The code may have sections that are unused or not called appropriately (e.g., a method in an interface but not implemented in a class).
- Found in line no. - N/A
- Possible treatments - ['Remove Unused Code', 'Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy', 'Remove Parameter']
- Possible solution - Review the usage of IPersonGood and IStudentGood to ensure that all declared methods are utilized or remove any unused methods.
