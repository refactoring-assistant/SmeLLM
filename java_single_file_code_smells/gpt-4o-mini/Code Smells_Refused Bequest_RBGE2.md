**Code Review: RBGE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The class IpadNotesGood is exposing methods that are not part of its interface NoteTakerGood, leading to a tight coupling with clients that access it. It violates the principle of encapsulation by requiring external classes to know about internal workings of IpadNotesGood.
- Found in line no. - 27

- Possible solution - 
```java
interface NoteTakerGood {
    void writeNotes();
}

class IpadNotesGood implements NoteTakerGood {
    @Override
    public void writeNotes() {
        System.out.println("Notes written on iPad.");
    }

    public void shareNotesAsPdf() {
        System.out.println("Notes shared as PDF.");
    }
}

class NotebookNotesGood implements NoteTakerGood {
    @Override
    public void writeNotes() {
        System.out.println("Notes written on Notebook.");
    }
}

public class RBGE2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NoteTakerGood ipad = new IpadNotesGood();
        ipad.writeNotes();
        ((IpadNotesGood) ipad).shareNotesAsPdf(); // This could be avoided by providing an interface method for sharing.

        NoteTakerGood notebook = new NotebookNotesGood();
        notebook.writeNotes();
    }
}
```
In this solution, it would be beneficial to add a method in the `NoteTakerGood` interface that can be overridden by classes that have a sharing functionality. Alternatively, use different classes for different note-sharing methods.
