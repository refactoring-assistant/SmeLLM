**Code Review: POGE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - Methods that are excessively long and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.
- Found in line no. - 16
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Introduce Null Object
- Possible solution - 
```java
public void printStaffDetails() {
    printEmployeeDetails("Employee Name: " + empName, "Employee ID: " + empId);
    printEmployeeType();
    System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
}

private void printEmployeeDetails(String... details) {
    for (String detail : details) {
        System.out.println(detail);
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Groups of data that are frequently passed together should be encapsulated in their own class.
- Found in line no. - 5, 6, 12
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution -
```java
class EmployeeDetails {
    private String empName;
    private String empId;

    public EmployeeDetails(String empName, String empId) {
        this.empName = empName;
        this.empId = empId;
    }

    // Getters and other methods
}
```
Then modify the `TeachingStaffGood` constructor to accept an `EmployeeDetails` object.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - Classes that are too tightly coupled, requiring too much inside knowledge of each other to function correctly.
- Found in line no. - 23, 27
- Possible treatments - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Class & Hide Delegate
- Possible solution - Move `printEmployeeType()` to a dedicated class that handles employee details and types.
```java
class EmployeeTypePrinter {
    public static void print(Type type) {
        System.out.println("Employee Type: " + type);
    }
}
```
And simply call `EmployeeTypePrinter.print(employeeType)` in `printStaffDetails()`.
```
