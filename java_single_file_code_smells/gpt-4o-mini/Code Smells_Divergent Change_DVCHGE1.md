**Code Review: DVCHGE1.java**
    - Code smell no. - 1
    - Code smell name - Switch Statements
    - Code smell description - Switch statements are often a sign that code is not using polymorphism properly. They can lead to a violation of the Open/Closed Principle by requiring modifications in multiple places for adding new cases.
    - Found in line no. - 13, 80
    - Possible treatments - ['Extract Method & then Move Method', 'Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Conditional with Polymorphism', 'Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods', 'Introduce Null Object']
    - Possible solution - Refactor the `perform_add_subtract` and `printMatrixResult` methods to utilize polymorphism. Define an interface for operations that the logger can implement, allowing the switch statement to be replaced with a call to the appropriate method based on the object's type.

**Code Review: DVCHGE1.java**
    - Code smell no. - 2
    - Code smell name - Long Method
    - Code smell description - A long method can be hard to understand and maintain. It violates the Single Responsibility Principle by doing too much in a single method.
    - Found in line no. - 65, 80
    - Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
    - Possible solution - Break down the `performMultiplication` and `perform_add_subtract` methods into smaller, more manageable methods. Each subtask (e.g., setting the result, performing an addition or subtraction operation) can be extracted into separate methods.

**Code Review: DVCHGE1.java**
    - Code smell no. - 3
    - Code smell name - Data Clumps
    - Code smell description - Groups of data that are often passed together can indicate that those values should be encapsulated into an object. 
    - Found in line no. - 28, 29, 30
    - Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
    - Possible solution - Create a new class (e.g., `MatrixPair`) that encapsulates `matrix1` and `matrix2` together and modify the methods to accept this new class as a parameter.
  
**Code Review: DVCHGE1.java**
    - Code smell no. - 4
    - Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
    - Code smell description - The use of primitives for specific values (like matrix operations) which can lead to the complexity of handling inherent behaviors.
    - Found in line no. - 13, 80
    - Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', ' Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
    - Possible solution - Instead of using `String` for the operation type, create a class with specific behaviors for each operation. This will encapsulate operation behaviors and reduce dependency on primitive types.
