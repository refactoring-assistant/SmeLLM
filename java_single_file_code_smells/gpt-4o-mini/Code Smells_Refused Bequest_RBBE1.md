- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of `Character` for `key` and mouse direction using a String representation in `MouseDirectionBad`.
- Found in line no. - (~21~), (~39~), (~4~)
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy']
- Possible solution - 
```java
class Key {
    private Character value;

    public Key(Character value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return value.toString();
    }
}

enum MouseDirection {
    UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT;
}

// Usage (in Computer class)
Keyboard keyboard = new Keyboard();
keyboard.click(new Key('a'));
Mouse mouse = new Mouse();
mouse.move(MouseDirection.UP);
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Feature Envy
- Code smell description - The method `clickKeyboard` in `MobileBad` has no additional functionality and simply overrides without using the inheritance effectively.
- Found in line no. - (~61~), (~66~)
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method', 'Extract Method']
- Possible solution -
```java
class Mobile extends Computer {
    public Mobile(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    // Remove clickKeyboard since it does nothing
    // Possibly implement other methods that are specific to mobile
}
```

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - There are no comments explaining the purpose of the classes and methods.
- Found in line no. - (~1~), (~18~), (~56~), (~74~)
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Variable', 'Extract Method', 'Rename Method', 'Introduce Assertion']
- Possible solution - Add JavaDoc comments for each class and method explaining their purpose and usage.
```java
/**
 * Enum representing the mouse directions.
 */
enum MouseDirection { ... }

/**
 * Represents a computer with basic functionalities.
 */
class Computer { ... }

/**
 * Represents a mobile device extending computer functionalities.
 */
class Mobile extends Computer { ... }
