**Code Review: CBE3.java**
    - Code smell no. - 1
    - Code smell name - Comments
    - Code smell description - Presence of comments that explain the purpose or behavior of the code, indicating that the code may not be self-explanatory.
    - Found in line no. - 5, 16
    - Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
    - Possible solution - Refactor the class `UserAddressBad` by ensuring that variable names and method names are descriptive enough to eliminate the need for comments. For example, instead of commenting the variable initializations, use meaningful method names for printing the formatted address.

```java
class UserAddress {
    private final String street;
    private final String city;
    private final String state;

    public UserAddress(String street, String city, String state) {
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void displayAddress() {
        System.out.println("The address of this user is " + street + ", " + city + ", " + state);
    }
}

public class CBE3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserAddress userAddress = new UserAddress("1234", "New York City", "NY");
        userAddress.displayAddress();
    }
}
```
