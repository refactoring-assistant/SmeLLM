**Code Review: LPLGE2.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The method `calculateCartPrice()` contains multiple statements, resulting in excessive complexity and longer method size, making it hard to read and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 72
- Possible treatments - Extract Method
- Possible solution - Refactor `calculateCartPrice()` into smaller methods such as `calculateSubtotal()`, `applyDiscounts()`, and `applyFees()` to improve readability and reduce complexity.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - Each class, particularly `ShoppingCartGood`, has multiple responsibilities (managing products bought, calculating prices), making it harder to maintain and understand.
- Found in line no. - 56
- Possible treatments - Extract Class
- Possible solution - Split `ShoppingCartGood` into multiple classes such as `ProductManager`, `PriceCalculator`, and so on, focusing on a single responsibility per class.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Related data is passed around in several methods, particularly stateTax, fees, storeDiscount, and memberDiscount in multiple classes.
- Found in line no. - 6, 28, 34, 10
- Possible treatments - Introduce Parameter Object
- Possible solution - Create a new class called `Pricing` that includes the related fields (stateTax, storeDiscount, memberDiscount, fees) and pass the instance of this class to the constructors of the relevant classes.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive types for representing related concepts such as price and discount which could be better represented as classes with behavior.
- Found in line no. - 5, 28, 10, 34
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object
- Possible solution - Define classes like `Discount` and `Tax` to encapsulate logic around discounts and taxes for better clarity and control in the codebase.

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - There are no comments explaining the purpose of classes and methods, which could help in understanding the code's functionality better.
- Found in line no. - 4, 27, 56, 90
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Introduce Assertion
- Possible solution - Add comments to classes and methods to describe their responsibilities and expected behavior, making the code more self-documenting.
