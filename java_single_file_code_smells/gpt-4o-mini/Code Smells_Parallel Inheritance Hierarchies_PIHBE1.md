- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Use of primitive data types instead of small objects for better encapsulation and to introduce meaningful entity behavior.
- Found in line no. - 12, 34
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object
- Possible solution - Introduce a `Vehicle` class that encapsulates the model and engineType properties instead of passing them as primitives to the constructors of `CarBad` and `BikeBad`.

```java
class Vehicle {
    private String model;
    private String engineType;

    public Vehicle(String model, String engineType) {
        this.model = model;
        this.engineType = engineType;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public String getEngineType() {
        return engineType;
    }
}

// Update CarBad and BikeBad constructors
public CarBad(Vehicle vehicle) {
    super(vehicle.getModel(), vehicle.getEngineType());
    this.factory = new CarFactoryBad("Default " + vehicle.getModel() + " Factory");
}

public BikeBad(Vehicle vehicle) {
    super(vehicle.getModel(), vehicle.getEngineType());
    this.factory = new BikeFactoryBad("Default " + vehicle.getModel() + " Factory");
}
```
