    - Code smell no. - 1
    - Code smell name - Long Method
    - Code smell description - A method that is too long and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable methods for better readability and maintainability.
    - Found in line no. - 10, 14, 28
    - Possible treatments - Extract Method
    - Possible solution - 
    ```java
    public void changeDayToNextDay() {
        changeDayAndPrint(1);
    }

    public void changeDayToPreviousDay() {
        changeDayAndPrint(-1);
    }

    private void changeDayAndPrint(int days) {
        defaultDay = changeDay(days);
        printDay();
    }
    ```

    - Code smell no. - 2
    - Code smell name - Data Class
    - Code smell description - A class that contains only data, with little or no behavior, not encapsulating its fields.
    - Found in line no. - 4
    - Possible treatments - Encapsulate Field
    - Possible solution - 
    ```java
    class TrackDayGood {
        private Date defaultDay;

        public Date getDefaultDay() {
            return new Date(defaultDay.getTime());
        }

        // Existing methods remain unchanged
    }
    ```

    - Code smell no. - 3
    - Code smell name - Feature Envy
    - Code smell description - A class that is overly dependent on another classâ€™s methods or data.
    - Found in line no. - 18, 23
    - Possible treatments - Move Method
    - Possible solution - Move the `isGivenDateNextDay(Date givenDate)` and `isGivenDatePreviousDay(Date givenDate)` methods to a new class called `DayComparator` that handles date comparisons.
    ```java
    class DayComparator {
        public boolean isNextDay(Date currentDay, Date givenDate) {
            Date nextDay = new Date(currentDay.getTime() + TrackDayGood.MILLIS_IN_DAY);
            return nextDay.compareTo(givenDate) == 0;
        }

        public boolean isPreviousDay(Date currentDay, Date givenDate) {
            Date prevDay = new Date(currentDay.getTime() - TrackDayGood.MILLIS_IN_DAY);
            return prevDay.compareTo(givenDate) == 0;
        }
    }
    ```

    - Code smell no. - 4
    - Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
    - Code smell description - The use of primitive data types to represent complex data.
    - Found in line no. - 32
    - Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object
    - Possible solution - Introduce a new class named `DayChange`, which encapsulates the logic for changing dates.
    ```java
    class DayChange {
        private Date currentDay;

        public DayChange(Date day) {
            this.currentDay = day;
        }

        public Date change(int days) {
            return new Date(currentDay.getTime() + days * TrackDayGood.MILLIS_IN_DAY);
        }

        // Other methods for comparison can be added here
    }
    ```
