**Code Review: DCBE3.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types (double) to represent domain concepts such as loan principal, rate, time, and interest can lead to a lack of meaningful context and may complicate future modifications.
- Found in line no. - 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 36, 48
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy.
- Possible solution - Define classes such as `Amount`, `Rate`, `Time` to encapsulate the primitives and use them in the constructors and methods. For example:
    ```java
    class Amount {
        private final double value;
        public Amount(double value) { this.value = value; }
        public double getValue() { return this.value; }
    }

    class Rate {
        private final double value;
        public Rate(double value) { this.value = value; }
        public double getValue() { return this.value; }
    }

    class Time {
        private final double value;
        public Time(double value) { this.value = value; }
        public double getValue() { return this.value; }
    }
    
    abstract class AbstractLoanValuesBad implements ILoanValuesBad {
        protected Amount principal;
        protected Rate rate;
        protected Time time;
    
        public AbstractLoanValuesBad(Amount principal, Rate rate, Time time) {
            this.principal = principal;
            this.rate = rate;
            this.time = time;
            this.interest = calculateInterest();
        }
    
        // Remaining methods remain unchanged
    }
    ```
