**Code Review: CBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class contains multiple fields and methods which lead to a large and complex class potentially violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Found in line no. - 1
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass
- Possible solution - To address this, we can create separate classes for different responsibilities, for example, creating an `OrderAmountCalculator` class that handles the calculation logic.

```java
class Order {
    private int orderID;
    private String orderName;
    private String orderStatus;

    public Order(int orderID, String orderName, String orderStatus) {
        this.orderID = orderID;
        this.orderName = orderName;
        this.orderStatus = orderStatus;
    }

    public void printOrderDetails() {
        System.out.println("Order ID: " + orderID);
        System.out.println("Order Name: " + orderName);
        System.out.println("Order Status: " + orderStatus);
    }
}

class OrderAmountCalculator {
    private double discount = 0.15;
    private double tax = 0.1;

    public double calculateTotalAmount(int numItems, double perItemCost) {
        return (numItems * perItemCost) * (1 - discount) * (1 + tax);
    }
}

public class CBE1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Order order = new Order(1, "Laptop", "confirmed");
        OrderAmountCalculator calculator = new OrderAmountCalculator();
        double totalAmount = calculator.calculateTotalAmount(2, 500);
        System.out.println("Order Amount: " + Math.round(totalAmount));
        order.printOrderDetails();
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - There are several comments in the code that explain the logic, which indicates that the code might not be self-explanatory.
- Found in line no. - 17, 21, 23, 24, 25
- Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- Possible solution - Instead of comments, the method `solve` can be split into smaller methods with descriptive names that make the code self-explanatory.

```java
public void solve(int numItems, double perItemCost) {
    orderAmount = calculateOrderAmount(numItems, perItemCost);
}

private double calculateOrderAmount(int numItems, double perItemCost) {
    return (numItems * perItemCost) * (1 - discount) * (1 + tax);
}
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The code uses primitive data types (int, double, String) for representing complex ideas, like an order.
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object
- Possible solution - Create an `OrderDetails` class that encapsulates the details of the order such as amount, status, discount, and tax.

```java
class OrderDetails {
    private double orderAmount;
    private double discount;
    private double tax;
    private String orderStatus;

    public OrderDetails(double discount, double tax, String orderStatus) {
        this.discount = discount;
        this.tax = tax;
        this.orderStatus = orderStatus;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
}
```
``` 

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - The `discount` and `tax` fields are initialized but not used effectively, leading to confusion.
- Found in line no. - 12, 13
- Possible treatments - Remove Unused Code, Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy, Remove Parameter
- Possible solution - If the discount and tax values are constants, consider making them `final static` or removing them if they are unnecessary in the calculations.

```java
private final static double DISCOUNT = 0.15;
private final static double TAX = 0.1;
```
