**Code Review: IIBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - A class that is trying to do too much. It has multiple responsibilities and can affect the readability and maintainability.
- Found in line no. - 6, 29, 47
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface, Duplicate Observed Data
- Possible solution - Break down the `SubjectMarksBad`, `EnglishBad`, and `TeacherBad` classes into smaller classes focused on single responsibilities. For example, create separate classes for handling marks, grades, and teacher management.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Using primitive data types instead of small classes for a specific purpose, which can lead to unclear code and loss of extensibility.
- Found in line no. - 7, 8, 17
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
- Possible solution - Create a `Grade` class that encapsulates the `Character` grade and its associated value, simplifying the management of grades and improving clarity.

---

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - Classes that are too tightly coupled, with one class excessively relying on the internals of another.
- Found in line no. - 48, 58
- Possible treatments - Move Method & Move Field, Extract Class & Hide Delegate, Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional, Replace Delegation with Inheritance
- Possible solution - Avoid direct access to the `marks` field of `EnglishBad` in `TeacherBad`. Instead, create a method in `EnglishBad` that sets the marks.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Feature Envy
- Code smell description - A class that is more interested in the features of another class than its own, indicating a potential design flaw.
- Found in line no. - 38
- Possible treatments - Move Method, Extract Method, Extract Method with Move Method
- Possible solution - The `getGrade` method in `EnglishBad` should be refactored to minimize dependency on the `SubjectMarksBad` and potentially be handled internally, making `EnglishBad` more autonomous.

---

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - Code that is not used or executed, which can clutter the codebase and confuse developers.
- Found in line no. - 41, 42
- Possible treatments - Remove Unused Code, Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy, Remove Parameter
- Possible solution - Review the method in `EnglishBad` and either remove or implement it properly to ensure relevant functionality or completely delete it if unnecessary.
