- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - A group of data items that are often passed together or used together, indicating they may be part of a distinct concept.
- Found in line no. - 70
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - 
```java
// Refer to previous possible solution implementation with ShoppingCartDetails as a new class for grouped parameters.
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - A method that is too long or complex, making it hard to understand and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 78
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
- Possible solution - 
```java
public double calculateCartPrice(Map<String, Double> priceList, double storeDiscount, double memberDiscount, double tax, double fees) {
    double totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(priceList);

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Lazy Class
- Code smell description - A class that has too few responsibilities or is not being used to its full potential.
- Found in line no. - 27
- Possible treatments - ['Inline Class', 'Collapse Hierarchy']
- Possible solution - 
```java
// Combine the StoreMemberPricingBad and StorePricingBad classes into a single Pricing class that handles both member and store pricing.
class Pricing {
    private double memberDiscount;
    private double storeDiscount;
    private double fees;
    private Map<String, Double> productPricePerQuantity;
    
    public Pricing(double storeDiscount, double memberDiscount, Map<String, Double> productPricePerQuantity, double fees) {
        this.memberDiscount = memberDiscount;
        this.storeDiscount = storeDiscount;
        this.productPricePerQuantity = productPricePerQuantity;
        this.fees = fees;
    }

    // Add methods to manage this class functionality
}
```

Overall, this code example exhibits several design issues that can be improved through restructuring to follow best practices.
