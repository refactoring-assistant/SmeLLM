- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Data Class
- Code smell description - A class that is primarily used to hold data and does not have significant behavior or functionality.
- Found in line no. - [4-12]
- Possible treatments - ['Encapsulate Field', 'Encapsulate Collection ', 'Move Method and Extract Method', 'Remove Setting Method and Hide Method']
- Possible solution -
```java
class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipcode;

    // constructor, getters, and setters
}

class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private String accountType;

    // constructor, deposit, withdraw, and other relevant methods
}
```

Note: Further encapsulation could be carried out to improve clarity and usability of these classes.
