**Code Review: LCGE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive data types (like double and String) for attributes and method parameters can lead to code that is less clear and harder to manage, especially as the data grows in complexity.
- Found in line no. - 19, 44, 74, 80, 104, 105, 106, 107
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Array with Object.
- Possible solution - Define classes such as `Money` which encapsulate the amount and currency, and `AccountNumber` which ensure proper structure and validation. This can clean the corresponding attributes and parameters in the relevant classes.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Parameter List
- Code smell description - Methods such as constructors or method parameters that take too many arguments can be difficult to understand and maintain.
- Found in line no. - 30, 54
- Possible treatments - Replace Parameter with Method Call, Preserve Whole Object, Introduce Parameter Object.
- Possible solution - Create a class called `AddressDetails` to encapsulate the fields of `AddressGood` and another class `BankAccountDetails` for `BankAccountGood` which would reduce the number of parameters needed when creating instances.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Groups of data that always appear together can indicate that a new class should be created to group them.
- Found in line no. - 19-22, 44-46, 74-76
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object.
- Possible solution - Create a new class `Address` that encompasses street, city, state, and zipcode as a single object instead of having them as separate fields in `AddressGood`.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Dead Code
- Code smell description - Code that is no longer used or referenced by any part of the system can increase maintenance overhead.
- Found in line no. - 24-28, 48-52 
- Possible treatments - Remove Unused Code, Inline Class or Collapse Hierarchy.
- Possible solution - If there are unused constructors, they should be removed to clean the class for clarity, ensuring all necessary functionalities remain intact while eliminating redundancy.
