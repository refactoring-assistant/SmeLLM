**Code Review: DVCHBE1.java**
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class `SquareMatrixOperationsBad` handles multiple responsibilities related to matrix operations and contains many methods that may lead to complexity if further expanded.
- Found in line no. - 3
- Possible treatments - Extract Class, Extract Subclass, Extract Interface
- Possible solution - Consider splitting the `SquareMatrixOperationsBad` class into separate classes, such as `MatrixAdder`, `MatrixSubtracter`, and `MatrixMultiplier`, each responsible for a specific operation.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The method `perform_add_subtract` has a lengthy structure; it can benefit from simplification and structuring.
- Found in line no. - 50
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Decompose Conditional
- Possible solution - Break down the switch-case structure into separate methods for `perform_add` and `perform_subtract`.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Switch Statements
- Code smell description - The method contains a `switch` statement which can lead to difficulties in maintenance and extensibility.
- Found in line no. - 53
- Possible treatments - Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy
- Possible solution - Use polymorphism by creating an interface for operations and implementing it in separate classes for each operation type.

- Code smell no. - 4
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The use of primitive types (int arrays) instead of objects for matrix representation may lead to difficulties in handling and manipulating matrix data.
- Found in line no. - 4, 5, 6
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Replace Array with Object
- Possible solution - Create a `Matrix` class to encapsulate matrix operations and properties, allowing for better management and abstraction.

- Code smell no. - 5
- Code smell name - Duplicate Code
- Code smell description - The methods for adding and subtracting matrices exhibit code duplication in their structure.
- Found in line no. - 14, 23
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
- Possible solution - Consolidate the logic of `add2Matrix` and `subtract2Matrix` into a single method that takes an operation parameter, reducing redundancy.
