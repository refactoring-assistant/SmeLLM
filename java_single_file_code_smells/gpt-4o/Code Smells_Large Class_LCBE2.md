**Code Review: LCBE2.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Divergent Change
- Code smell description - The `PersonBad` class has methods that may be intended for different contexts or responsibilities, leading to multiple areas of change in the future when either only person details or student details need modification.
- Found in line no. - 5, 16, 20
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Superclass & Extract Subclass']
- Possible solution - Separate concerns by creating different classes for distinct responsibilities: 

```java
interface IPersonDetails {
    void printPersonDetails();
}

interface IStudentDetails {
    void printStudentDetails();
}

class Person implements IPersonDetails {
    private String name;
    
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void printPersonDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
    }
}

class Student extends Person implements IStudentDetails {
    private String studentId;
    private String major;
    
    public Student(String name, String studentId, String major) {
        super(name);
        this.studentId = studentId;
        this.major = major;
    }

    public void printStudentDetails() {
        printPersonDetails();
        System.out.println("Student ID: " + this.studentId);
        System.out.println("Major: " + this.major);
    }
}

public class LCBE2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IStudentDetails student1 = new Student("John", "123456", "Computer Science");
        System.out.println("Only person details:");
        student1.printPersonDetails();
        System.out.println("Student details:");
        student1.printStudentDetails();
    }
}
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Inappropriate Intimacy
- Code smell description - The `PersonBad` class directly accesses and prints student details, indicating tight coupling between responsibilities that could be better managed through separation.
- Found in line no. - 20, 21, 22, 23
- Possible treatments - ['Move Method & Move Field', 'Extract Class & Hide Delegate', 'Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional', 'Replace Delegation with Inheritance']
- Possible solution - Use composition or inheritance to separately handle person and student attributes. The previous solution also resolves this smell. 

By applying the proposed solution, the identified code smells will be addressed, leading to more maintainable and clearly defined code structure.
