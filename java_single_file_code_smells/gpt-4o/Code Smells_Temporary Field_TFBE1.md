**Code Review: TFBE1.java**
  - Code smell no. - 1
  - Code smell name - Large Class
  - Code smell description - A class has grown so large that it does too much work and is difficult to understand and maintain.
  - Found in line no. - [1]
  - Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
  - Possible solution - Break down the `LoanBad` class into smaller classes that handle specific responsibilities such as `InterestCalculator`.

  - Code smell no. - 2
  - Code smell name - Long Method
  - Code smell description - A method contains too much logic, making it difficult to understand or modify.
  - Found in line no. - [18-26]
  - Possible treatments - ['Extract Method', 'Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Decompose Conditional']
  - Possible solution - Extract the logic inside the `calculateInterest()` method into smaller, more focused methods such as `calculateShortTermInterest()` and `calculateLongTermInterest()`.

  - Code smell no. - 3
  - Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
  - Code smell description - The use of basic data types to represent domain ideas and values. This tends to make the code harder to understand and change.
  - Found in line no. - [2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
  - Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', ' Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
  - Possible solution - Introduce a `Term` class to represent the `term` and `numMonths`, and an `InterestRate` class to encapsulate interest-related computations.

  - Code smell no. - 4
  - Code smell name - Data Clumps
  - Code smell description - The same group of data fields are always passed around together.
  - Found in line no. - [9, 18]
  - Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
  - Possible solution - Extract a `LoanDetails` class to encapsulate `principal`, `interestRate`, and `term`.

**Refactored Code Proposal:**

```java
class InterestCalculator {
    private double principal;
    private InterestRate interestRate;
    private Term term;

    public InterestCalculator(double principal, InterestRate interestRate, Term term) {
        this.principal = principal;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
        this.term = term;
    }

    public double calculateInterestAmount() {
        if (term.getYears() < 1) {
            int numMonths = term.calculateMonths();
            return principal * interestRate.getMonthlyRate() * numMonths;
        } else {
            return principal * interestRate.getAnnualRate() * term.getYears();
        }
    }
}

class InterestRate {
    private double annualRate;

    public InterestRate(double annualRate) {
        this.annualRate = annualRate;
    }

    public double getAnnualRate() {
        return annualRate;
    }

    public double getMonthlyRate() {
        return annualRate / 12;
    }
}

class Term {
    private double years;

    public Term(double years) {
        this.years = years;
    }

    public double getYears() {
        return years;
    }

    public int calculateMonths() {
        return (int) Math.ceil(years * 12);
    }
}

public class TFBE1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoanBad loan = new LoanBad(1000, new InterestRate(0.1), new Term(0.5));
        InterestCalculator calculator = new InterestCalculator(
            1000, new InterestRate(0.1), new Term(0.5));
        double interestAmount = calculator.calculateInterestAmount();
        double totalAmount = 1000 + interestAmount;
        System.out.println("Total amount to be paid: " + totalAmount);
    }
}
```
This refactoring introduces separate classes to encapsulate specific concerns, reduces complexity, and addresses identified code smells.
