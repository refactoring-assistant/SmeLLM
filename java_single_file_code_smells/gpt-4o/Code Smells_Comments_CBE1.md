**Code Review: CBE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - The class `OrderBad` uses primitive data types (int, String, double) for order details instead of objects that could encapsulate behaviors and validations related to orders.
- Found in line no. - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Possible treatments - Replace Data Value with Object, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy, Replace Array with Object
- Possible solution - Create a class for OrderDetails that encapsulates orderID, orderName, orderAmount, discount, tax, and orderStatus.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Comments
- Code smell description - Excessive use of comments in `solve` method to explain simple processes, which could be self-explanatory had the code been better encapsulated and designed.
- Found in line no. - 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25
- Possible treatments - Extract Variable, Extract Method, Rename Method, Introduce Assertion
- Possible solution - Use descriptive names for methods and variables to make the code self-explanatory, eliminating the need for comments.

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Long Method
- Code smell description - The `solve` method handles multiple operations in a single block without decomposition, making it longer than necessary and hard to maintain.
- Found in line no. - 20-26
- Possible treatments - Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object, Decompose Conditional
- Possible solution - Break down the calculations in the `solve` method by extracting smaller methods for each step of calculation (e.g., `calculateDiscount`, `calculateTax`) and refactor the long method into these appropriately named methods.

**Redefined Code Solution:**

```java
class OrderDetails {
    private int orderID;
    private String orderName;
    private double orderAmount;
    private double discount;
    private double tax;
    private String orderStatus;

    public OrderDetails(int orderID, String orderName, double discount, double tax, String orderStatus) {
        this.orderID = orderID;
        this.orderName = orderName;
        this.discount = discount;
        this.tax = tax;
        this.orderStatus = orderStatus;
    }

    public void calculateOrderAmount(int numItems, double perItemCost) {
        double baseAmount = numItems * perItemCost;
        double discountedAmount = applyDiscount(baseAmount);
        this.orderAmount = applyTax(discountedAmount);
    }

    private double applyDiscount(double amount) {
        return amount * (1 - discount);
    }

    private double applyTax(double amount) {
        return amount * (1 + tax);
    }

    public void printOrderDetails() {
        System.out.println("Order ID: " + orderID);
        System.out.println("Order Name: " + orderName);
        System.out.println("Order Amount: " + Math.round(orderAmount));
        System.out.println("Order Status: " + orderStatus);
    }
}

public class CBE1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OrderDetails orderDetails = new OrderDetails(1, "Laptop", 0.15, 0.1, "confirmed");
        orderDetails.calculateOrderAmount(2, 500);
        orderDetails.printOrderDetails();
    }
}
```
This redefined code eliminates the `OrderBad` class, reducing primitive obsession by encapsulating fields in the `OrderDetails` class and removing the unnecessary comments through meaningful method names that indicate their functionality, effectively treating the identified code smells.
