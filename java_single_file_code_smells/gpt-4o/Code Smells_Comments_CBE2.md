**Code Review: CBE2.java**
    
- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Using primitive arrays to represent a matrix is a form of primitive obsession. Instead, a dedicated class should be used to handle the data and operations related to a matrix.
- Found in line no. - [2, 4, 13, 24]
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Define a `Matrix` class to encapsulate the array and provide methods for transposition and printing.

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Temporary Field
- Code smell description - A temporary field is created to hold the transposed matrix and is not used elsewhere. This could be handled by a method directly to avoid clutter.
- Found in line no. - [13]
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class or Replace Method with Method Object.', 'Introduce Null Object']
- Possible solution - Create a method `transposeMatrix` which returns the transposed version of the matrix directly.

        this.matrix = matrix;
    }

    public Matrix transpose() {
        int[][] transposed = new int[matrix[0].length][matrix.length];

            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
                transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }

        Matrix matrix = new Matrix(array);

        System.out.println("Original Matrix:");
        matrix.printMatrix();
        
        System.out.println("Transposed Matrix:");
