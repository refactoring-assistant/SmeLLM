**Code Review: POBE1.java**

- Code smell no. - 1
- Code smell name - Large Class
- Code smell description - The class `HealthRecordBad` has too many responsibilities and manages a lot of data, suggesting it could be decomposed.
- Found in line no. - [2-119]
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Extract Subclass', 'Extract Interface', 'Duplicate Observed Data']
- Possible solution - Decompose the `HealthRecordBad` class into smaller classes, such as `Patient`, `PatientMedicalData`, `MedicationRecord`, etc., to manage different aspects of a health record.

```java
class HealthRecord {
    private Patient patient;
    private MedicalData medicalData;
    private MedicationRecord medicationRecord;
    private AllergyRecord allergyRecord;
    private DiseaseHistoryRecord diseaseHistoryRecord;

    public HealthRecord(String patientIdentifier, String[] patientName, String[] patientAddress, String insuranceNumber) {
        patient = new Patient(patientIdentifier, patientName, patientAddress, insuranceNumber);
        medicalData = new MedicalData("N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A");
        medicationRecord = new MedicationRecord();
        allergyRecord = new AllergyRecord();
        diseaseHistoryRecord = new DiseaseHistoryRecord();
    }
    
    // Other methods delegating to respective classes
}

class Patient {
    private String identifier;
    private String[] name;
    private String[] address;
    private String insuranceNumber;

    public Patient(String identifier, String[] name, String[] address, String insuranceNumber) {
        this.identifier = identifier;
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
        this.insuranceNumber = insuranceNumber;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}

class MedicalData {
    private String bloodGroup;
    private String height;
    private String weight;
    private String age;

    public MedicalData(String bloodGroup, String height, String weight, String age) {
        this.bloodGroup = bloodGroup;
        this.height = height;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}

// Similar classes for MedicationRecord, AllergyRecord, and DiseaseHistoryRecord
```

- Code smell no. - 2
- Code smell name - Primitive Obsession
- Code smell description - Use of primitive arrays for fields like patientName, patientAddress, previousMedication, etc., suggests a better design could be achieved using small class structures.
- Found in line no. - [8-14], [32-36], [79-116]
- Possible treatments - ['Replace Data Value with Object', 'Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object', 'Replace Type Code with Class, Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy', 'Replace Array with Object']
- Possible solution - Replace arrays with structured objects to better encapsulate related data.

```java
class PatientName {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    public PatientName(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}

class PatientAddress {
    private String streetNumber;
    private String streetName;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String country;

    public PatientAddress(String streetNumber, String streetName, String city, String state, String country) {
        this.streetNumber = streetNumber;
        this.streetName = streetName;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.country = country;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}

// Use these in the HealthRecord class
```

- Code smell no. - 3
- Code smell name - Data Clumps
- Code smell description - Groups of data are used together often in the constructor and methods, indicating they should be bundled.
- Found in line no. - [16-21], [32-36]
- Possible treatments - ['Extract Class', 'Introduce Parameter Object', 'Preserve Whole Object']
- Possible solution - Introduce Parameter Objects for frequently grouped data.

```java
class MedicalBiodata {
    private String bloodGroup;
    private String height;
    private String weight;
    private String age;

    public MedicalBiodata(String bloodGroup, String height, String weight, String age) {
        this.bloodGroup = bloodGroup;
        this.height = height;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}

// Use in methods like updatePatientMedicalData
```

These changes collectively improve readability, maintainability, and clarity of the code by effectively utilizing encapsulation and the single-responsibility principle.
