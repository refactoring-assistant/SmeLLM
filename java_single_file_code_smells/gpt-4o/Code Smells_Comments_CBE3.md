**Code Review: CBE3.java**
    
  - Code smell no. - 1
  - Code smell name - Comments
  - Code smell description - The code contains unnecessary comments that describe what the code does, rather than why it does it. This can clutter the code and make it harder to read.
  - Found in line no. - 1, 2, 5, 16
  - Possible treatments - ['Extract Variable', 'Extract Method', 'Rename Method', 'Introduce Assertion']
  - Possible solution - Remove the comments that describe the purpose and the functionality of the code when the code is self-explanatory.

```java
class UserAddress {
    private final String street;
    private final String city;
    private final String state;

    public UserAddress(String street, String city, String state) {
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void printFormattedAddress() {
        System.out.println("The address of this user is " + street + ", " + city + ", " + state);
    }
}

public class CBE3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserAddress userAddress = new UserAddress("1234", "New York City", "NY");
        userAddress.printFormattedAddress();
    }
}
```

Note: The class name has been changed from `UserAddressBad` to `UserAddress`, as adding the term "Bad" doesnâ€™t provide meaningful context in the class name. The code is straightforward, and the comments were not adding value beyond what the code already conveys.
